<h2>Aunt Crete’s Emancipation</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<br />
<small>A TELEGRAM AND A FLIGHT</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-w.jpg" width="90" height="103" alt="W" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi">“WHO’S at the front door?” asked Luella’s
mother, coming in from the kitchen with
a dish-towel in her hand. “I thought I
heard the door-bell.”</p>

<p>“Luella’s gone to the door,” said her sister from
her vantage-point at the crack of the sitting-room
door. “It looks to me like a telegraph boy.”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t be, Crete,” said Luella’s mother
impatiently, coming to see for herself. “Who
would telegraph now that Hannah’s dead?”</p>

<p>Lucretia was short and dumpy, with the comfortable,
patient look of the maiden aunt that
knows she is indispensable because she will meekly
take all the burdens that no one else wants to bear.
Her sister could easily look over her head into the
hall, and her gaze was penetrative and alert.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know, Carrie,” said Lucretia
apprehensively; “but I’m all of a tremble. Telegrams
are dreadful things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nonsense, Crete, you always act like such a
baby. Hurry up, Luella. Don’t stop to read it.
Your aunt Crete will have a fit. Wasn’t there
anything to pay? Who is it for?”</p>

<p>Luella, a rather stout young woman in stylish
attire, with her mother’s keen features unsoftened
by sentiment, advanced, irreverently tearing
open her mother’s telegram and reading it
as she came. It was one of the family grievances
that Luella was stout like her aunt instead
of tall and slender like her mother. The aunt
always felt secretly that they somehow blamed her
for being of that type. “It makes one so hard to
fit,” Luella’s mother remarked frequently, and
adding with a disparaging glance at her sister’s
dumpy form, “So impossible!”</p>

<p>At such times the aunt always wrinkled up her
pleasant little forehead into a V upside down, and
trotted off to her kitchen, or her buttonholes, or
whatever was the present task, sighing helplessly.
She tried to be the best that she could always; but
one couldn’t help one’s figure, especially when one
was partly dependent on one’s family for support,
and dressmakers and tailors took so much money.
It was bad enough to have one stout figure to fit
in the family without two; and the aunt always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
felt called upon to have as little dressmaking done
as possible, in order that Luella’s figure might be
improved from the slender treasury. “Clothes do
make a big difference,” she reflected. And sometimes
when she was all alone in the twilight, and
there was really nothing that her alert conscience
could possibly put her hand to doing for the
moment, she amused herself by thinking what
kind of dress she would buy, and who should make
it, if she should suddenly attain a fortune. But
this was a harmless amusement, inasmuch as she
never let it make her discontented with her lot,
or ruffle her placid brow for an instant.</p>

<p>But just now she was “all of a tremble,” and
the V in her forehead was rapidly becoming a
double V. She watched Luella’s dismayed face
with growing alarm.</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake alive!” said Luella, flinging
herself into the most comfortable rocker, and
throwing her mother’s telegram on the table.
“That’s not to be tolerated! Something’ll have to
be done. We’ll have to go to the shore at once,
mother. I should die of mortification to have a
country cousin come around just now. What
would the Grandons think if they saw him? I can’t
afford to ruin all my chances for a cousin I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
never seen. Mother, you simply must do something.
I won’t stand it!”</p>

<p>“What in the world are you talking about,
Luella?” said her mother impatiently. “Why
didn’t you read the telegram aloud, or why didn’t
you give it to me at once? Where are my glasses?”</p>

<p>The aunt waited meekly while her sister found
her glasses, and read the telegram.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare! That is provoking to have him
turn up just now of all times. Something must
be done, of course. We can’t have a gawky Westerner
around in the way. And, as you say, we’ve
never seen him. It can’t make much difference
to him whether he sees us or not. We can hurry
off, and be conveniently out of the way. It’s probably
only a ‘duty visit’ he’s paying, anyway.
Hannah’s been dead ten years, and I always heard
the child was more like his father than his mother.
Besides, Hannah married and went away to live
when I was only a little girl. I really don’t think
Donald has much claim on us. What a long telegram!
It must have cost a lot. Was it paid for?
It shows he knows nothing of the world, or he
would have put it in a few words. Well, we’ll have
to get away at once.”</p>

<p>She crumpled the telegram into a ball, and flung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
it to the table again; but it fell wide of its mark,
and dropped to the floor instead. The aunt
patiently stooped and picked it up, smoothing out
the crushed yellow paper.</p>

<p>“Hannah’s boy!” she said gently, and she
touched the yellow paper as if it had been something
sacred.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Am taking a trip East, and shall make you a little
visit if convenient. Will be with you sometime on
Thursday.</p>

<p class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Donald Grant.</span>”<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>She sat down suddenly in the nearest chair.
Somehow the relief from anxiety had made her
knees weak. “Hannah’s boy!” she murmured
again, and laid her hand caressingly over the telegram,
smoothing down a torn place in the edge
of the paper.</p>

<p>Luella and her mother were discussing plans.
They had decided that they must leave on the
early train the next morning, before there was
any chance of the Western visitor’s arriving.</p>

<p>“Goodness! Look at Aunt Crete,” said Luella,
laughing. “She looks as if she had seen a ghost.
Her lips are all white.”</p>

<p>“Crete, you oughtn’t to be such a fool. As if a
telegram would hurt you! There’s nobody left to
be worried about like that. Why don’t you use
your reason a little?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hannah’s boy is really coming!” beamed Aunt
Crete, ignoring their scorn of herself.</p>

<p>“Upon my word! Aunt Crete, you look as if it
were something to be glad about, instead of a
downright calamity.”</p>

<p>“Glad; of course I’m glad, Luella. Wouldn’t
you be glad to see your oldest sister’s child?
Hannah was always very dear to me. I can see
her now the way she looked when she went away,
so tall and slim and pretty——”</p>

<p>“Not if she’d been dead for a century or so, and
I’d never seen the child, and he was a gawky, embarrassing
creature who would spoil the prospects
of the people I was supposed to love,” retorted
Luella. “Aunt Crete, don’t you care the least bit
for my happiness? Do you want it all spoiled?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course not, dearie,” beamed Aunt
Crete, “but I don’t see how it will spoil your happiness.
I should think you’d want to see him yourself.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Crete! The idea! He’s nothing to me.
You know he’s lived away out in the wild West all
his life. He probably never had much schooling,
and doesn’t know how to dress or behave in polite
society. I heard he went away off up in the Klondike
somewhere, and worked in a mine. You can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
imagine just what a wild, ignorant creature he
will be. If Clarence Grandon should see him, he
might imagine my family were all like that; and
then where would I be?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Crete, I’m surprised at you. You’ve been
so anxious all along for Luella to shine in society,
and now you talk just as if you didn’t care in the
least what happened,” put in Luella’s mother.</p>

<p>“But what can you do?” asked Aunt Crete.
“You can’t tell him not to come—your own sister’s
child!”</p>

<p>“O, how silly you are, Crete!” said her sister.
“No, of course we can’t very well tell him not to
come, as he hasn’t given us a chance; for this telegram
is evidently sent on the way. It is dated
‘Chicago,’ and he hasn’t given us a trace of an
address. He doesn’t live in Chicago. He’s very
likely almost here, and may arrive any time to-morrow.
Now you know we’ve simply got to go
to the shore next week, for the rooms are all engaged
at the hotel, and paid for; and we might as
well hurry up and get off to-night or early in the
morning, and escape him. Luella would die of
mortification if she had to cousin that fellow and
give up her trip to the shore. As you weren’t
going anyway, you can receive him. It will keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
him quietly at home, for he won’t expect an old
woman to go out with him, and show him the
sights; so nobody will notice him much, and there
won’t be a lot of talk. If he looks very ridiculous,
and that prying Mrs. Brown next door speaks of
it, you might explain he’s the son of an old school
friend who went out West to live years ago——”</p>

<p>“O Carrie!” exclaimed Aunt Crete, “that
wouldn’t be true; and, besides, he can’t be so very
bad as that. And even if he is, I shall love him—for
he’s Hannah’s boy.”</p>

<p>“Love him all you want to,” sniffed her sister,
“but for pity’s sake don’t let the neighbors know
what relation he is.”</p>

<p>“That’s just like you, Aunt Crete,” said Luella
in a hurt tone. “You’ve known me and pretended
to love me all your life. I’m almost like your own
child, and yet you take up with this unknown
nephew, and say you’ll love him in spite of all the
trouble he’s making me.”</p>

<p>Aunt Crete doubled the V in her forehead, and
wiped away the beads of perspiration. Somehow
it always seemed that she was in the wrong.
Would she be understood in heaven? she wondered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Luella and her mother went on planning. They
told off what Aunt Crete was to do after they left.</p>

<p>“There’s the raspberries and blackberries not
done up yet, Crete, but I guess you can manage
alone. You always do the biggest part of the
canning, anyway. I’m awfully sorry about your
sewing, Crete. I meant to fit your two thin dresses
before we went away, but the dressmaker made
Luella’s things so much more elaborate than I expected
that we really haven’t had a minute’s time,
what with all the lace insertion she left for us to
sew on. Perhaps you better run down to Miss
Mason, and see if she has time to fit them, if you
think you can’t wait till we get back. You’ll
hardly be going out much while we’re gone, you
know.”</p>

<p>“O, I’ll be all right,” said Aunt Crete happily.
“I guess I can fix up my gray lawn for while
Donald’s here.”</p>

<p>“Donald! Nonsense! It won’t matter what you
wear while he’s here. He’ll never know a calico
from a silk. Now look here, Crete, you’ve got to
be awfully careful, or you’ll let out when we went
off. There’s no use in his finding out we didn’t
want to see him. You wouldn’t want to hurt his
feelings, you know. Your own sister’s child!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, of course not,” agreed Aunt Crete, though
there was a troubled look in her eyes. She never
liked prevarication; and, when she was left with
some polite fabrication to excuse her relatives
out of something they wanted to shirk, she nearly
always got it twisted so that it was either an out-and-out
lie, which horrified her, or else let the
whole thing “out of the bag,” as Luella said.</p>

<p>But there was little time for discussion; for
Luella and her mother had a great deal of packing
to do, and Aunt Crete had the dinner to get and
the house to set in order, surreptitiously, for the
expected guest.</p>

<p>They hurried away the next morning in a whirl
of bags and suitcases and parasols and umbrellas.
They had baggage enough for a year in Europe,
although they expected to stay only two or three
weeks at the shore at most. Aunt Crete helped
them into the station-cab, ran back to the house
for Luella’s new raincoat, back again for the veil
and her sister’s gloves, and still a third time to
bring the new book, which had been set aside for
reading on the journey. Then at last they were
gone, and with one brief sigh of satisfaction Aunt
Crete permitted herself to reflect that she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
actually left alone to receive a dear guest all her
own.</p>

<p>Never in all her maiden existence had she had
this pleasure before. She might use the best
china, and have three kinds of pie at once, yes,
and plum-cake if she chose. Boys like pie and
cake. Donald would be a big, nice boy.</p>

<p>What did it matter to her if he was awkward
and from the West? He was in a large sense her
own. Hannah was gone, and there was no one
else to take a closer place. Who but his mother’s
sister should have the right to mother him for a
while? He would be her own as Luella never had
been, because there was always Luella’s mother
to take the first place. Besides, Luella had been
a disappointing baby. Even in her infancy she
had developed an independence that scorned kissing
and cuddling. Luella always had too many selfish
interests on hand to have time for breathing
out love and baby graces to admiring subjects.
Her frown was always quicker than her smile.
But somehow Aunt Crete felt that it would be different
with this boy, and her heart swelled within
her as she hurried into the house to make ready
for his coming.</p>

<p>The front hall was littered with rose-leaves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Luella had shaken a bunch of roses to get rid of
the loose leaves, and had found they were all loose
leaves; therefore she flung them down upon the
floor. She had meant to wear them with her new
pongee travelling-suit. It looked well to wear
roses on a journey, for it suggested a possible
admirer. But the roses had not held out, and now
Aunt Crete must sweep them up.</p>

<p>A glance into the parlor showed peanut-shells
scattered over the floor and on the table. A few
of Luella’s friends had come in for a few minutes
the evening before, and they had indulged in peanuts,
finishing up by throwing the shells at one
another amid shouts of hilarious laughter. Aunt
Crete went for the broom and dust-pan. If he
came early, the hall and parlor must be in order
first.</p>

<p>Luella and her mother had little time to waste,
for the tickets were barely bought and the trunks
checked before the train thundered up. It was a
through vestibuled train; and, as Luella struggled
up the steps of one car with her heavy suitcase, a
tall young man with dark, handsome eyes and a
distinguished manner swung himself down the
steps of the next car.</p>

<p>“Hello, Luella!” called a voice from a pony-cart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
by the platform. “You’re not going away to-day,
are you? Thought you said you weren’t going till
next week.”</p>

<p>“Circumstances made it necessary,” called Luella
from the top step of the car while the porter held
up the suitcase for her to take. “I’m running
away from a backwoods cousin that’s coming to
visit. I’ll write and tell you all about it. Good-by.
Sorry I can’t be at your house to-morrow
night, but it couldn’t be helped.”</p>

<p>Then Luella turned another gaze upon the handsome
stranger, who was standing on the platform
just below her, looking about interestedly. She
thought he had looked at her more than casually;
and, as she settled herself in the seat, she glanced
down at her pongee travelling-suit consciously,
feeling that he could but have thought she looked
well.</p>

<p>He was still standing on the platform as the
train moved out, and Luella could see the girl in
the pony-cart turn her attention to him. She half
wished she were sitting in the pony-cart too. It
would be interesting to find out who he was.
Luella preened herself, and settled her large hat
in front of the strip of mirror between the windows,
and then looked around the car that she
might see who were her fellow passengers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad we’re off,” said her mother nervously.
“I was afraid as could be your cousin
might come in on that early through train before
we got started. It would have been trying if he’d
come just as we were getting away. I don’t know
how we could have explained it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Luella. “I’m glad we’re safely off.
He’ll never suspect now.”</p>

<p>It was just at that moment that the grocery-boy
arrived at the back door with a crate of red raspberries.</p>

<p>“Land alive!” said Miss Crete disappointedly.
“I hoped those wouldn’t come till to-morrow.” She
bustled about, taking the boxes out of the crate so
that the boy might take it back; and before she
was done the door-bell rang.</p>

<p>“Land alive!” said Miss Crete again as she
wiped her hands on the kitchen towel and hurried
to the front door, taking off her apron as she went.
“I do hope he hasn’t come yet. I haven’t cleared
off that breakfast-table; and, if he should happen
to come out, there’s three plates standing.”</p>

<p>But the thought had come too late. The dining-room
door was stretched wide open, and the table
in full view. The front door was guarded only by
the wire screen. The visitor had been able to take
full notes, if he so desired.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br /><br />

<small>THE BACKWOODS COUSIN</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Miss Lucretia</span> opened the screen, and noticed
the fine appearance of the young man standing
there. He was not shabby enough for an agent.
Some one had made a mistake, she supposed. She
waited pleasantly for him to tell his errand.</p>

<p>“Is this where Mrs. Carrie Burton lives?” he
asked, removing his hat courteously.</p>

<p>And, when she answered, “Yes,” his whole face
broke into dancing eagerness.</p>

<p>“Is this my Aunt Carrie? I wonder”; and he
held out a tentative, appealing hand for welcome.
“I’m Donald Grant.”</p>

<p>“O!” said Miss Lucretia delightedly, “O!” and
she took his hand in both her own. “No, I ain’t
your Aunt Carrie, I’m your Aunt Crete; but I’m
just as glad to see you. I didn’t think you’d be so
big and handsome. Your Aunt Carrie isn’t home.
They’ve just—why—that is—they are—they had
planned to be at the shore for three weeks, and
they’ll be real sorry when they know——.” This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
last sentence was added with extra zeal, for Aunt
Crete exulted in the fact that Carrie and Luella
would indeed be sorry if they could look into their
home for one instant and see the guest from whom
they had run away. She felt sure that if they had
known how fine-looking a young man he was, they
would have stayed and been proud of him.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry they are away,” said the young man,
stooping to kiss Aunt Crete’s plump, comfortable
cheek; “but I’m mighty glad you’re at home, Aunt
Crete,” he said with genuine pleasure. “I’m going
to like you for all I’m worth to make up for
the absence of my aunt and cousin. You say they
have gone to the shore. When will they be at
home? Is their stay there almost up?”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” said Aunt Crete, flushing uncomfortably.
“They haven’t been gone long. And
they’ve engaged their rooms there for three weeks
at a big hotel. Luella, she’s always been bound
to go to one of those big places where rich people
go, the Traymore. It’s advertised in all the
papers. I expect you’ve seen it sometimes. It’s
one of the most expensive places at the shore. I’ve
almost a notion to write and tell them to come
home, for I’m sure they’ll be sorry when they hear
about you; but you see it’s this way. There’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
young man been paying Luella some attention, and
he’s going down there soon; I don’t know but he’s
there already; and his mother and sister are
spending the whole season there; so Luella had
her heart set on going down and boarding at the
same hotel.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see,” said the nephew. “Well, it wouldn’t
do to spoil my cousin’s good time. Perhaps we
can run down to the shore for a few days ourselves
after we get acquainted. Say, Aunt Crete,
am I too late for a bite of breakfast? I was so
tired of the stuff they had on the dining-car I
thought I’d save up my appetite till I got here,
for I made sure you’d have a bite of bread and
butter, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Bless your dear heart, yes,” said Aunt Crete,
delighted to have the subject turned; for she had a
terrible fear she would yet tell a lie about the departure
of her sister and niece, and a lie was a
calamity not always easily avoided in a position
like hers. “You just sit down here, you dear boy,
and wait about two minutes till I set the coffee-pot
over the fire and cut some more bread. It isn’t
a mite of trouble, for I hadn’t cleared off the
breakfast-table yet. In fact, I hadn’t rightly finished
my own breakfast, I was so busy getting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
rights. The grocery-boy came, and—well, I never
can eat much when folks are going—I mean when
I’m alone,” she finished triumphantly.</p>

<p>She hurried out into the dining-room to get the
table cleared off, but Donald followed her. She
tried to scuttle the plates together and remove all
traces of the number of guests at the meal just
past, but she could not be sure whether he noticed
the table or not.</p>

<p>“May I help you?” asked the young man, grabbing
Luella’s plate and cup, and following her
into the kitchen. “It’s so good to get into a real
home again with somebody who belongs to me.
You know father is in Mexico, and I’ve been in the
university for the last four years.”</p>

<p>“The university!” Aunt Crete’s eyes shone. “Do
you have universities out West? My! Won’t Luella
be astonished? I guess she thinks out West is all
woods.”</p>

<p>Donald’s eyes danced.</p>

<p>“We have a few good schools out there,” he said
quietly.</p>

<p>While they were eating the breakfast that Aunt
Crete prepared in an incredibly short space of
time, Donald asked a great many questions. What
did his aunt and cousin look like? Was Aunt Carrie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
like her, or like his mother? And Luella, had she
been to college? And what did she look like?</p>

<p>Aunt Crete told him mournfully that Luella was
more like herself than like her mother. “And it
seems sometimes as if she blamed me for it,” said
the patient aunt. “It makes it hard, her being a
sort of society girl, and wanting to look so fine.
Dumpy figures like mine don’t dress up pretty,
you know. No, Luella never went to college. She
didn’t take much to books. She liked having a
good time with young folks better. She’s been
wanting to go down to the shore and be at a real
big hotel for three summers now, but Carrie never
felt able to afford it before. We’ve been saving
up all winter for Luella to have this treat, and I
do hope she’ll have a good time. It’s real hard
on her, having to stay right home all the time
when all her girl friends go off to the shore. But
you see she’s got in with some real wealthy people
who stay at expensive places, and she isn’t satisfied
to go to a common boarding-house. It must
be nice to have money and go to a big hotel. I’ve
never been in one myself; but Luella has, and
she’s told all about it. I should think it would be
grand to live that way awhile with not a thing
to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>



<p>“They ought to have taken you along, Aunt
Crete,” said the young man. “I do hope I didn’t
keep you at home to entertain me.”</p>

<p>“O, no, bless your heart,” said the aunt, “I
wasn’t going. I never go anywhere. Why, what
kind of a figure would I cut there? It would spoil
all Luella’s good time to have me around, I’m so
short-waisted. She always wants me to wear a
coat when I go anywhere with her, so people won’t
see how short-waisted I am.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Donald. “I think you are
lovely, Aunt Crete. You’ve got such pretty white
hair, all wavy like mother’s; and you’ve got a fine
face. Luella ought to be proud to have you.”</p>

<p>Aunt Crete blushed over the compliment, and
choking tears of joy throbbed for a minute in her
throat.</p>

<p>“Now hear the boy!” she exclaimed. “Donald,
do have another cup of coffee.”</p>

<p>After breakfast Aunt Crete showed her guest
to his room, and then hurried down to get the
stack of dishes out of the way before he came
down again. But he appeared in the kitchen
door in a few minutes.</p>

<p>“Give me a dish and some berries,” he demanded.
“I’m going to help you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 428px;">
<img src="images/i-034.jpg" width="428" height="500" alt="Donald and Aunt Crete canning" />
<div class="caption">“HE HELPED WITH VIGOR”</div>
</div>
<p>And despite all her protests he helped with
such vigor that by twelve o’clock twenty-one jars
of crimson berries stood in a shining row on the
kitchen table, and Aunt Crete was dishing up a
savory dinner for two, with her face shining as
brightly as if she had done nothing but play the
whole morning.</p>

<p>“We did well, didn’t we?” said Donald as he
ate his dinner. “I haven’t had such a good time
since I went camping in the Klondike. Now after
we get these dishes washed you are going to take
a nice long nap. You look tired and warm.”</p>

<p>Aunt Crete protested that she was not tired,
but Donald insisted. “I want you to get nice and
rested up, because to-morrow we’re going shopping.
By the way, I’ve brought you a present.”
He sprang up from the table, and went to his suitcase
to get it.</p>

<p>Aunt Crete’s heart beat with anticipation as
he handed her a little white box. What if it should
be a breastpin? How she would like that! She
had worn her mother’s, a braid of hair under a
glass, with a gold band under it, ever since she
was grown up; and sometimes she felt as if it was
a little old-fashioned. Luella openly scoffed at it,
and laughed at her for wearing it; but no one ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
suggested getting her a new one, and, if she had
ventured to buy one for herself, she knew they
would have thought her extravagant.</p>

<p>She opened the box with excited fingers, and
there inside was a little leather case. Donald
touched a spring, and it flew open and disclosed
a lovely star made all of seed-pearls, reposing on
white velvet. It was a “breastpin” indeed, and
one fit for a queen. Fortunately Aunt Crete did
not know enough about jewelry to realize what it
cost, or her breath might have been taken away.
As it was, she was dumb for the moment. Such
a beautiful pin, and for her! She could scarcely
believe it. She gazed and gazed, and then, laying
the box on the table, rose up and took Donald’s
face in her two toil-worn hands, and kissed him.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you like it,” he said with a pleased
smile. “I wasn’t quite sure what to get, but the
salesman told me these were always nice. Now
let’s get at these dishes.”</p>

<p>In a daze of happiness Aunt Crete washed the
dishes while Donald wiped them, and then despite
her protests he made her go up-stairs and lie
down.</p>

<p>When had she ever taken a nap in the daytime
before? Not since she was a little girl and fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
from the second-story window. The family had
rushed around her frightened, and put her to bed
in the daytime; and for one whole day she had
been waited upon and cared for tenderly. Then
she had been able to get up; and the hard, careless,
toilsome world had rushed on again for her.
But the memory of that blessed day of rest,
touched by gentleness, had lingered forever a
bright spot in her memory. She had always been
the one that did the hard things in her family,
even when she was quite young.</p>

<p>Aunt Crete lay cautiously down upon her neatly
made bed after she had attired herself in her best
gown, a rusty black and white silk made over
from one Luella had grown tired of, and clasped
her hands blissfully on her breast, resting with
her eyes wide open and a light of joy upon her
face. She hardly felt it right to relax entirely,
lest Donald might call her; but finally the unaccustomed
position in the middle of the day sent
her off into a real doze, and just about that time
the telephone bell rang.</p>

<p>The telephone was in the sitting-room down-stairs.
It had been put in at the time when the
telephone company were putting them in free to
introduce them in that suburb. It was ordinarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
a source of great interest to the whole family,
though it seldom rang except for Luella. Luella
and her mother were exceedingly proud of its
possession.</p>

<p>Donald was in the sitting-room reading. He
looked up from his paper, hesitated a moment,
and then took down the receiver. Perhaps his
aunt was asleep already, and he could attend to
this without waking her.</p>

<p>“Hello; is this 53 M?”</p>

<p>Donald glanced at the number on the telephone,
and answered, “Yes.”</p>

<p>“Here you are, Atlantic. Here is Midvale,”
went on the voice of the operator at central.</p>

<p>“Hello! Is that you Aunt Crete? This is Luella,”
came another girl’s strident voice in hasty impatience.
“What in the world were you so long
about answering the ’phone for? I’ve been waiting
here an age. Now, listen, Aunt Crete. For heaven’s
sake don’t you tell that crazy cousin of ours
where to find us, or like as not he’ll take a notion
to run down here and see us; and I should simply
die of mortification if he did. This is a very swell
hotel, and it would be fierce to have a backwoods
relation appear on the scene. Now be sure you
keep dark. I’ll never forgive you if you don’t.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
And say, Aunt Crete, won’t you please sew on the
rest of that Val edging down the ruffles of the
waist and on the skirt of my new lavender organdie,
and do it up, and send it by mail? I forgot all
about it. It’s on the bed in the spare room, and
the edging is started. You sew it on the way it is
begun. You’ll see. Now don’t you go to sewing
it on in that old way because it is quicker; for it
doesn’t look a bit pretty, and you’ve nothing much
else to do, now we’re gone, anyway. And say,
Aunt Crete, would you mind going down to Peters’s
to-day, and telling Jennie I forgot all about getting
those aprons to finish for the fair, and tell her
you’ll finish them for her? Do it to-day, because she
has to send the box off by the end of the week.
And mother says you better clean the cellar right
away, and she wondered if you’d feel equal to
whitewashing it. I should think you’d like to do
that, it’s so cool this warm weather to be down
cellar. And, O, yes, if you get lonesome and want
something to do, I forgot to tell you I left those
three flannel shirt-waists all cut out ready to be
made in the upper bureau drawer of the spare
room. Now don’t read your eyes out the way
you did the last time we went off and left you, and
have to wear dark glasses for a week, because I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
have lots of things planned to do when I get home.
I’m going to have Helena Bates for a week, and
there’ll be several lunches and picnics doing. O,
say, Aunt Crete, mother says, if there’s any more
pie-cherries to be had, you better put up some;
and be sure and stone them all. I just hate them
with the seeds in. And I guess that’s all; only
don’t forget you promised to have all those buttonholes
worked for me in those underclothes I’m
making, before I get back. Are you all right? Let
me see. There was something else. O, yes, mother
says you don’t need to get out the best china and
make a great fuss as if you had grand company;
he’s only a country boy, you know. Say, Aunt
Crete. Are you there? Why don’t you answer?
Aunt Crete! Hello! For pity’s sake, what is the
matter with this ’phone? Hello, central! O, dear!
I suppose she’s gone away. That’s the way Aunt
Crete always does!”</p>

<p>Donald, a strange, amused expression upon his
face, stood listening and hesitating. He did not
know exactly what to do. Without any intention
at all he had listened to a conversation not intended
for his ears. Should he answer and tell
who he was? No, for that would but embarrass
Luella. Neither would it do to call Aunt Crete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
now, for they would be sure to find out he had
heard. Perhaps it was better to keep entirely
still. There seemed to be nothing serious at stake.
Ruffles, and shirt-waists, and gingham aprons for
a guild, and whitewashing the cellar! Nobody
would die if none of them were done, and his blood
boiled over the tone in which the invisible cousin
at the other end of the wire had ordered Aunt
Crete about. He could read the whole life-story
of the patient self-sacrifice on the one hand and
imposition on the other. He felt strongly impelled
to do something in the matter. A rebuke
of some sort should be administered. How could
it best be done?</p>

<p>Meantime Luella was fuming with the telephone
girl, and the girl was declaring that she could
get no answer from Midvale any more. Donald
stood wickedly enjoying their discomfiture, and
was at last rewarded by hearing Luella say: “Well,
I guess I’ve said all I want to say, anyway; so you
needn’t ring them up again. I’ve got to go out
boating now.” The receiver at the shore clicked
into place, and the connection was cut off.</p>

<p>Then the young man hung up the receiver at the
Midvale end of the line, and sat down to think.
Bit by bit he pieced together the story until he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
very nearly made out the true state of affairs. So
they were ashamed of him, and were trying to get
away. Could it be possible that they had been the
people that got on the train as he got off? Was
that girl with the loud voice and the pongee suit
his cousin? The voice over the telephone seemed
like the one that had called to the girl in the pony-cart.
And had his eyes deceived him, or were
there three plates on the breakfast-table that
morning? Poor Aunt Crete! He would give her the
best time he knew how, and perhaps it was also
set for him to give his cousin a lesson.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III<br /><br />

<small>A WONDERFUL DAY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Crete</span> woke up at last from an uncomfortable
dream. She thought Carrie and Luella
had come back, and were about to snatch Donald
away from her and bear him off to the shore.</p>

<p>She arose in haste and smoothed her hair, astonished
at the freshness of her own face in the glass.
She was afraid she had overslept and lost some of
the precious time with Donald. There was so
much to ask him, and he was so good to look at.
She hurried down and was received warmly.
Donald’s meditations had culminated in a plan.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Aunt Crete; are you sure you are
rested? Then I want to talk. Suppose we run
down to the shore and surprise the folks. How
soon could you be ready?”</p>

<p>“O dear heart! I couldn’t do that!” exclaimed
Aunt Crete, her face nevertheless alight with
pleasure at the very thought.</p>

<p>“Why not? What’s to hinder?”</p>

<p>“O, I never go. I always stay at home and
attend to things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“But that’s no reason. Why couldn’t things
attend to themselves?”</p>

<p>“Why, I couldn’t leave the house alone.”</p>

<p>“Now, what in the world could possibly happen
to the house that you could prevent by staying in
it? Be reasonable, dear aunt. You know the
house won’t run away while you are gone, and, if
it does, I’ll get you another one. You don’t mean
to tell me you never go off on a vacation. Then
it’s high time you went, and you’ll have to stay
the longer to make up for lost time. Besides, I
want your company. I’ve never seen the Eastern
coast, and expect to enjoy it hugely; but I need
somebody to enjoy it with me. I can’t half take
things in alone. I want somebody my very own
to go with me. That’s what I came here for. I
had thought of inviting you all to go down for a
little trip; but, as the others are down there, why,
we can join them.”</p>

<p>Aunt Crete’s face clouded. What would Luella
say at having them appear on her horizon? The
young man was all right, apparently, but there
was no telling how angry Luella might be if her
aunt came. She knew that Luella preferred to
keep her in the background.</p>

<p>“I really couldn’t go, dear,” she said wistfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
“I’d like it with all my heart. And it would be
specially nice to go with you, for I never had anybody
to go round with me, not since your mother
was a girl and used to take me with her wherever
she went. I missed her dreadfully after she was
married and went West. She was always so good
to me.”</p>

<p>The young man’s face softened, and he reached
his hand impulsively across the table, and grasped
the toil-worn hand of his aunt.</p>

<p>“Well, you shall have somebody to go round
with you now, auntie; that is, if you’ll let me. I’m
not going to take ‘No’ for an answer. You just
must go. We’ll have a vacation all by ourselves,
and do just as we please, and we’ll bring up at the
hotel where Aunt Carrie and Luella are, and surprise
them.”</p>

<p>“But, child, I can’t!” said Aunt Crete in dismay,
seeing his determination. “Why, I haven’t any
clothes suitable to wear away from home. We
were all so busy getting Luella fixed out that there
wasn’t any time left for mine, and it didn’t really
matter about me anyway. I never go anywhere.”</p>

<p>“But you’re going now, Aunt Lucretia,” said
he; “and it does matter, you see. Clothes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
easily bought. We’ll go shopping after breakfast
to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“But I really can’t afford it, Donald,” said his
aunt with an air of finality. “You know I’m not
rich. If Carrie weren’t good enough to give me a
home here, I shouldn’t know how to make two ends
meet.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that, Aunt Crete; this is my layout,
and I’m paying for it. We’ll go shopping to-morrow
morning. I’ve got some money in my
pocket I’m just aching to spend. The fact is,
Aunt Crete, I struck gold up there in the Klondike,
and I’ve got more money than I know what
to do with.”</p>

<p>“O!” said Aunt Crete with awe in her voice at
the thought of having more money than one knew
what to do with. Then shyly, “But——”</p>

<p>“But what, Aunt Lucretia?” asked Donald as
she hesitated and flushed till the double V came
into her forehead in the old helpless, worried way.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s lots of canning and house-cleaning
that has got to be done, and I don’t really think
Carrie would like it to have me leave it all, and
run away on a pleasure excursion.”</p>

<p>Righteous indignation filled the heart of the
nephew. “Well, I should like to know why she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
wouldn’t like it!” he exclaimed impulsively. “Has
she any better right to have a vacation than you?
I’m sure you’ve earned it. You blessed little
woman, you’re going to have a vacation now, in
spite of yourself. Just put your conscience away
in pink cotton till we get back—though I don’t
know whether I shall let you come back to stay.
I may spirit you off with me somewhere if I don’t
like the looks of my cousin. I’ll take all the responsibility
of this trip. If Aunt Carrie doesn’t
like it, she may visit her wrath on me, and I’ll tell
her just what I think of her. Anyhow, to the
shore you are going right speedily; that is, if you
want to go. If there’s some other place you’d
rather go besides to the Traymore, speak the word,
and there we’ll go. I want you to have a good
time.”</p>

<p>Aunt Crete gasped with joy. The thought of
the ocean, the real ocean, was wonderful. She
had dreamed of it many times, but never had seen
it, because she was always the one who could just
as well stay at home as not. She never got run
down or nervous or cross, and was ordered to go
away for her health; and she never insisted upon
going when the rest went. Her heart was bounding
as it had not bounded since the morning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the last Sunday-school picnic she had attended
when she was a girl.</p>

<p>“Indeed, dear boy, I do want to go with all my
heart if I really ought. I have always wanted to
see the ocean, and I can’t imagine any place I’d
rather go than the Traymore, Luella’s talked so
much about it.”</p>

<p>“All right. Then it’s settled that we go. How
soon can we get ready? We’ll go shopping to-morrow
morning bright and early, and get a trunkful
of new clothes. It’s always nice to have new
things when you go off; you feel like another person,
and don’t have to be sewing on buttons all
the time,” laughed Donald, as if he was enjoying
the whole thing as much as his aunt. “I meant
to have a good time getting presents for the whole
family; but, as they aren’t here, I’m going to get
them all for you. You’re not to say a word. Have
you got a trunk?”</p>

<p>“Trunk? No, child. I haven’t ever had any
need for a trunk. The time I went to Uncle
Hiram’s funeral I took Carrie’s old haircloth one,
but I don’t know’s that’s fit to travel again.
Carrie’s got her flannels packed away in camphor
in it now, and I shouldn’t like to disturb it.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll get a trunk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“O, no,” protested Aunt Crete; “that would be
a foolish expense. There’s some pasteboard boxes
up-stairs. I can make out with them in a shawl-strap.
I sha’n’t need much for a few days.”</p>

<p>“Enlarge your scale of things, Aunt Crete.
You’re going to stay more than a few days. You’re
going to stay till you’re tired, and just want to
come back. As we’re going to a ‘swell’ hotel,”—Donald
reflected that Aunt Crete could not understand
his reference to Luella’s description of the
Traymore,—“we can’t think of shawl-straps and
boxes. You shall have a good big trunk. I saw
an advertisement of one that has drawers and a
hat-box in it, like a bureau. We’ll see if we can
find one to suit.”</p>

<p>“It sounds just like the fairy tales I used to read
to Luella when she was a little girl,” beamed Aunt
Crete. “It doesn’t seem as if it was I. I can’t
make it true.”</p>

<p>“Now let’s write down a list of things you need,”
said the eager planner; “we’ll have to hurry up
things, and get off this week if possible. I’ve been
reading the paper, and they say there’s coming a
hot wave. I need to get you to the shore before
it arrives, if possible. Come; what shall I put
down first? What have you always thought you’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
like, Aunt Crete? Don’t you need some silk
dresses?”</p>

<p>“O dear heart! Hear him! Silk dresses aren’t
for me. Of course I’ve always had a sort of hankering
after one, but nothing looks very well on
me. Carrie says my figure is dumpy. I guess, if
you’re a mind to, you can get me a lace collar. It’ll
please me as well as anything. Luella saw some
for a quarter that were real pretty. She bought
one for herself. I think it would do to wear with
my new pin, and all my collars are pretty much
worn out.”</p>

<p>“Now look here, Aunt Crete! Can’t I make you
understand? I mean business, and no collars for
a quarter are going to do. You can have a few
cheap ones for morning if you want them, but
we’ll buy some real lace ones to wear with the pin.
And you shall have the silk dress, two or three of
them, and a lot of other things. What kind do
you want?”</p>

<p>“O my dear boy! You just take my breath away.
I with two or three silk dresses! The idea! Carrie
would think me extravagant, and Luella wouldn’t
like it a bit. She always tells me I’m too gay for
my years.”</p>

<p>Donald set his lips, and wished he could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
speech for a few minutes with the absent Luella.
He felt that he would like to express his contempt
for her treatment of their aunt.</p>

<p>“I’ve always thought I’d like a gray silk,”
mused Aunt Crete with a dreamy look in her eyes,
“but I just know Luella would think it was too
dressy for me. I suppose black would be better.
I can’t deny I’d like black silk, too.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have both,” said Donald decidedly. “I
saw a woman in a silver-gray silk once. She had
white hair like yours, and the effect was beautiful.
Then you’ll need some other things. White
dresses, I guess. That’s what my chum’s grandmother
used to wear when I went there visiting
in the summer.”</p>

<p>“White for me!” exclaimed the aunt. “O, Luella
would be real angry at me getting white. She says
it’s too conspicuous for old women to dress in light
colors.”</p>

<p>“Never mind Luella. We’re doing this, and
whatever we want goes. If Luella doesn’t like it,
she needn’t look at it.”</p>

<p>Aunt Crete was all in a flutter that night. She
could hardly sleep. She did not often go to town.
Luella did all the shopping. Sometimes she suggested
going, but Carrie always said it was a needless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
expense, and, besides, Luella knew how to buy
at a better bargain. It was a great delight to go
with Donald. Her face shone, and all the weariness
of the day’s work, and all the toilsome yesterdays,
disappeared from her brow.</p>

<p>She looked over her meagre wardrobe, most of
it cast-offs from Carrie’s or Luella’s half-worn
clothing, and wrote down in a cramped hand a few
absolute necessities. The next morning they had
an early breakfast, and started at once on their
shopping-expedition. Aunt Crete felt like a little
child being taken to the circus. The idea of getting
a lot of new clothes all for herself seemed too
serious a business to be true. She was dazed when
she thought of it; and so, when Donald asked what
they should look at first, she showed plainly that
she would be little help in getting herself fitted
out. She was far too happy to bring her mind
down to practical things, and, besides, she could
not adjust herself to the vast scale of expenditure
Donald had set.</p>

<p>“Here are some collars,” said Donald. “We
might as well begin on those.”</p>

<p>Aunt Crete examined them with enthusiasm,
and finally picked out two at twenty-five cents
apiece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are those the best you have?” questioned
Donald.</p>

<p>“O, no,” said the saleswoman, quick to identify
the purchaser that did not stop at price; “did you
want real or imitation?”</p>

<p>“Real, by all means,” he answered promptly.</p>

<p>“O Donald,” breathed Aunt Crete in a warning
whisper, “real lace comes dreadful high. I’ve
heard Luella say so. Besides, I shouldn’t have
anything to wear it with, nor any place to go fixed
up like that.”</p>

<p>“Have you forgotten you’re going to the Traymore
in a few days?” he asked her with a twinkle
in his eye. “And what about the gray silk? Won’t
it go with that? If not, we’ll get something better.”</p>

<p>Assisted by the saleswoman, they selected two
beautiful collars of real lace, and half a dozen
plain ones for commoner wear.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you go with us?” asked Donald of the
saleswoman as the purchase was concluded. “My
aunt wishes to get a good many things, and neither
she nor I is much used to shopping. We’d like
to have your advice.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry; I’d like to, but I’m not allowed to
leave this counter,” said the woman with a kindly
smile. “I’m head of this department, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
can’t get along without me this morning. But
they have buyers in the office just for that purpose.
You go up to the desk over on the east
side just beyond the rotunda, and ask for a buyer
to go around with you. Get Miss Brower if you
can, and tell her the head of the lace department
told you to call for her. She’ll tell you just what
to get,” and she smiled again at Aunt Crete’s
kindly, beaming face.</p>

<p>They went to the desk, and found Miss Brower,
who, when she heard the message, took them
smilingly under her wing. She knew that meant
a good sale had been made, and there would be
something in it for her. Besides, she had a kindly
disposition, and did not turn up a haughty nose
at Aunt Crete’s dumpy little figure.</p>

<p>“Now, just what do you want first?” she asked
brightly.</p>

<p>“Everything,” said Donald helplessly. “We’ve
only bought a lace collar so far, and now we want
all the rest of the things to go with it. The only
things we’ve decided on so far are two silk
dresses, a black one and a silver-gray. How do
we go about it to get them? Do they have them
ready-made?”</p>

<p>“Nothing that would be quite suitable, I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
afraid, in silks. But we’ll go and see what there
is in stock,” said the assistant with skilful eye,
taking in Aunt Crete’s smiling, helpless face,
lovely white hair, dumpy, ill-fitted figure, and all.
“There might be a gray voile that would suit her.
In fact, I saw one this morning, very simple and
elegant, lined with gray silk, and trimmed with
lace dyed to match. It is a beauty, and just reduced
this morning to thirty dollars from sixty.
I believe it will fit her.”</p>

<p>Aunt Crete gasped at the price, and looked at
Donald; but he seemed pleased, and said: “That
sounds good. Let’s go and see it. We’ll have a
gray—what was it you called it—voile? Remember
that name, Aunt Crete. You’re going to have
a gray voile. But we want the silk too. Do they
make things here? We want to go away in a few
days, and would like to take them with us.”</p>

<p>“O, yes, they’ll make anything to order; and
this time of year we’re not so busy. I guess you
could get a ‘hurry-up’ order on it, and have it
done in a couple of days; or it could be forwarded
to you if it was not quite finished when you left.”</p>

<p>They stepped into the elevator, and in a trice
were ushered into the presence of the rare and
the imported. Aunt Crete stood in a maze of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
delight and wonder. All this was on exhibition
just for her benefit, and she was Alice in Wonderland
for the hour. Donald stood back with his
arms folded, and watched her with satisfaction.
One thing alone was wanted to complete it. He
would have liked to have Luella up in the gallery
somewhere watching also. But that he held in
anticipation. Luella should be made to understand
that she had done wrong in underrating
this sweet, patient soul.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 394px;">
<img src="images/i-057.jpg" width="394" height="500" alt="Aunt Crete and Donald shopping" />
<div class="caption">“DONALD WATCHED HER WITH SATISFACTION”</div>
</div>

<p>The gray voile was entirely satisfactory to the
two shoppers. Donald recognized it as the thing
many women of his acquaintance wore at the receptions
he had attended in university circles.
Aunt Crete fingered it wistfully, and had her inward
doubts whether anything so frail and lovely,
like a delicate veil, would wear; but, looking at
Donald’s happy face, she decided not to mention
it. The dress was more beautiful than anything
she had ever dreamed of possessing. “But it
won’t fit me,” she sighed as she and Miss Brower
were on the way to the “trying-on” room, where
the garment was to be fitted to her. “I’m so
dumpy, you know, and Luella always says it’s no
use to get me anything ready-made.”</p>

<p>“O, the fitter will make it fit,” said Miss Brower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
convincingly; and then, with a glance at the ample
waist, whose old-fashioned lines lay meekly awry
as if they were used to being put on that way and
were beyond even discouragement: “Why don’t
you wear one of those stiffened waists? There’s
a new one on sale, has soft bones all around, and
is real comfortable. It would make your dresses
set a great deal better. If you like, I’ll go get one,
and you can be fitted over it. You don’t like anything
very tight, do you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Aunt Crete in a deprecatory tone, “I
never could bear anything real tight. That’s what
puts Luella out so about me. But, if you say
there’s a waist that’s comfortable, I should be so
obliged if you’d get it. I’d be willing to pay any
price not to look so dumpy.”</p>

<p>She felt that if it took the last cent she possessed,
and made all her relatives angry with her,
she must have something to fit her once.</p>

<p>Miss Brower, thus commissioned, went away,
and returned very soon with the magical waist
that was to transform Miss Lucretia’s “figger.”
If Donald could have seen his aunt’s face when she
was finally arrayed in the soft folds of the gray
voile and was being pinned up and pinned down
and pinned in and pinned out, he would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
fully repaid. Aunt Crete’s ecstasy was marred
only by the fact that Luella could not see her
grandeur. Actually being fitted in a department-store
to a “real imported” dress! Could mortal
attain higher in this mundane sphere?</p>

<p>When the fitting was pronounced done and
Aunt Crete was about to don her discouraged
shirt-waist once more, Miss Brower appeared in
the doorway with a coat and skirt suit over her
arm, made of fine soft black taffeta.</p>

<p>“Just put this on and let the gentleman see how
he likes it,” she said. She had been out to talk
over matters with Donald and have an understanding
as to what was wanted. She had advised
the taffeta coat and skirt for travelling, with an
extra cloth coat for cool days. Aunt Crete, with
the new dignity that consciousness of her improved
figure gave her, rustled out to her nephew
looking like a new woman, her face beaming.</p>

<p>That was a wonderful day. Aunt Crete retired
again for the black taffeta to be altered a little,
and yet again for a black and white dotted swiss,
and a white linen suit, and a handsome black crêpe
de chine, and then to have the measure taken for
the silver-gray silk, which the head dressmaker
promised could be hurried through. They bought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a black chiffon waist and some filmy, dreamy
white shirt-waists, simple and plain in design,
with exquisite lace simply applied, fine hand-made
tucks, and finer material. Miss Brower advised
white linen and white lawn for morning wear at
the seashore, and gave Aunt Crete confidence, telling
how she had a customer, “a woman about as
old as you, with just such lovely white hair,” who
but yesterday purchased a set of white dresses for
morning wear at the seashore. This silenced the
thoughts of her sister’s horror at “White for you,
Crete! What are you thinking of?” Never mind,
she was going to have one good time, even if she
had to put all her lovely finery away in a trunk
afterwards, and never bring it out again, or—dreary
thought—were made to cut it over for
Luella sometime. Well, it might come to that, but
at least she would enjoy it while it was hers.</p>

<p>Two white linen skirts, a handsome black cloth
coat, several pairs of silk gloves, black and white,
some undergarments dainty enough for a bride,
a whole dozen pairs of stockings! How Aunt Crete
rejoiced in those! She had been wearing stockings
whose feet were cut out of old stocking legs for
fifteen years. She couldn’t remember when she
had had a whole new pair of stockings all her own.
And then two new bonnets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>All these things were acquired little by little.
It was while they were in the millinery department,
and Miss Brower had just set a charming
black lace bonnet made on a foundation of white
roses on the white hair, that Donald decided she
was one of the most beautiful old ladies he had
ever seen. The drapery was a fine black lace scarf,
which swept around the roses and tied loosely on
the breast; and it gave the quiet little woman a
queenly air. She was getting used to seeing her
own face in strange adornments, but it startled
her to see that she really looked handsome in this
bonnet. She stood before the transformation in
the mirror almost in awe, and never heard what
Miss Brower was saying:</p>

<p>“That’s just the thing for best, and there’s a
lovely lace wrap in the cloak department she ought
to have to go with it. It would be charming.”</p>

<p>“Get it,” said Donald with respectful brevity.
He was astonished himself at the difference mere
clothes made. Aunt Crete was fairly impressive
in her new bonnet. And the lace wrap proved
indeed to be the very mate to the bonnet, hiding
the comfortable figure, and making her look “just
like other people,” as she breathlessly expressed
it after one glance at herself in the lace wrap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>They bought a plain black bonnet, a sweet little
gray one, a fine silk umbrella, a lot of pretty belts
and handkerchiefs, some shoes and rubbers, a
hand-bag of cut steel, for which Luella would have
bartered her conscience—what there was left of
it; and then they smiled good-by at Miss Brower,
and left her for a little while, and went to lunch.</p>

<p>Such a lunch! Soup, and fish, and spring lamb,
and fresh peas, and new potatoes, and two kinds
of ice-cream in little hard sugar cases that looked
like baked snow-balls. Aunt Crete’s hand trembled
as she took the first spoonful. The wonders
of the day had been so great that she was fairly
worn out, and two little bright red spots of excitement
had appeared in her cheeks, but she was
happy! Happier than she remembered ever to
have been in her life before. Her dear old conscience
had a moment of sighing that Luella could
not have been there to have enjoyed it too, and
then her heart bounded in wicked gleefulness that
Luella was not there to stop her nice time.</p>

<p>They went into a great hall in the same store,
and sat among the palms and coolness made by
electric fans, while a wonderful organ played exquisite
music, and Aunt Crete felt she certainly
was in heaven without the trouble of dying; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
she never dreamed, dear soul, that she had been
dying all her life that others might live, and that
it is to such that the reward is promised.</p>

<p>They went back to Miss Brower later; and
behold! the silver-gray silk had been cut out, and
was ready to fit. Aunt Crete felt it was fairy-work,
the whole of it, and she touched the fabric
as if it had been made by magic.</p>

<p>Then they went and bought a trunk and a handsome
leather satchel, and Donald took a notion
that his aunt must have a set of silver combs for
her hair such as he saw in the hair of another old
lady.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Donald reflectively, “we’ll go home
and get rested, and to-morrow we’ll come down
and buy any things we’ve forgotten.”</p>

<p>“And I’m sure I don’t see what more a body
could possibly need,” said Aunt Crete, as, tired
and absolutely contented, she climbed into the
train and sat down in the hot plush seat.</p>

<p>The one bitter drop in the cup of bliss came the
next morning—or rather two drops—in the shape
of letters. One from Aunt Carrie for Donald was
couched in stiffest terms, in which she professed
to have just heard of his coming, and to be exceedingly
sorry that she was not at home, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
kept from returning only by a sprained ankle, the
doctor telling her that she must not put her foot
to the ground for two or three weeks yet, or she
would have to suffer for it.</p>

<p>The other letter was for Aunt Crete, and was a
rehash of the telephone message, with a good
sound scolding for having gone away from the
telephone before she finished speaking. Luella
had written it herself because she felt like venting
her temper on some one. The young man that
had been so attentive to her in town had promenaded
the piazza with another young woman all
the evening before. Luella hoped Aunt Crete
would put up plenty of gooseberry jam. Aunt
Crete put on her double V as she read, and sighed
for a full minute before Donald looked up amused
from his letter.</p>

<p>“Now, Aunt Crete, you look as if a mountain
had rolled down upon you. What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“O, I’m just afraid, Donald, that I’m doing
wrong going off this way, when Carrie expects
me to do all this canning and sewing and cleaning.
I’m afraid she’ll never forgive me.”</p>

<p>“Now, Aunt Crete, don’t you love me? Didn’t I
tell you I’d stand between you and the whole
world? Please put that letter up, and come and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
help me pack your new trunk. Do you want that
gray silk put in first, or shall I put the shoes at
the bottom? Don’t you know you and I are going
to have the time of our lives? We’re going to
run away from every care. Do you suppose
your own sister would want you to stay here
roasting in the city if she knew you had a nephew
just aching to carry you off to the ocean? Come,
forget it. Cut it out, Aunt Crete, and let’s pack
the trunk. I’m longing to be off to smell the briny
deep.” And laughingly he carried her away, and
plunged her into thoughts of her journey, giving
her no time the rest of the day to think of anything
else.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />

<small>AUNT CRETE TRANSFORMED</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> locked the house early one morning when
even the dusty bricks had a smell of freshness to
them before the hot sun baked them for another
day. The closed blinds seemed sullen like a conquered
tyrant, and the front door looked reproachfully
at Aunt Crete as she turned the key carefully
and tried it twice to be sure it was locked. The
lonesome look of the house gave the poor old lady
a pang as she turned the corner in her softly rustling
silk coat and skirt. She felt it had hardly
been right to put on a new black silk in the morning,
and go off from all the cares of the world,
just leave them, boldly ignore them, like any giddy
girl, and take a vacation. She regarded herself
with awe and a rising self-respect in every window
she passed. Somehow the look of dumpiness
had passed away mysteriously. It was not her
old self that was passing along the street to the
station bearing a cut-steel hand-bag, while Donald
carried her new satchel, and her new trunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
bumped on a square ahead in the expressman’s
wagon.</p>

<p>It was a hot morning, and the great city station
seemed close and stuffy; but Aunt Crete mingled
with the steaming crowd blissfully. To be one
with the world, attired irreproachably; to be on
her way to a great hotel by the sea, with new
clothes, and escorted devotedly by some one that
was her very own, this indeed was happiness.
Could any one desire more upon the earth?</p>

<p>Donald put her into a cab at the station, and she
beamed happily out at the frightful streets that
always made her heart come into her mouth on
the rare occasions when she had to cross them.
The ride across the city seemed a brief and distinguished
experience. It was as if everybody else
was walking and they only had the grandeur of a
carriage. Then the ferry-boat was delightful to
the new traveller, with its long, white-ceiled passages,
and its smell of wet timbers and tarred
ropes. They had a seat close to the front, where
they could look out and watch their own progress
and see the many puffing monsters laboriously
plying back and forth, and the horizon-line of
many masts, like fine brown lines against the sky.
Aunt Crete felt that at last she was out in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
world. She could not have felt it more if she had
been starting for Europe.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i-070.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="Aunt Crete, well-dressed and smiling at other passengers" />
<div class="caption">“SHE BEAMED UPON THE WHOLE TRAINFUL OF PEOPLE”</div>
</div>


<p>The seashore train, with its bamboo seats and
its excited groups of children bearing tin pails and
shovels and tennis-rackets, filled her with a fine
exhilaration. At last, at last, her soul had escaped
the bounds of red brick walls that she had expected
would surround her as long as she lived.
She drew deep breaths, and beamed upon the
whole trainful of people, yelling baby and all. She
gazed and gazed at the fast-flying Jersey scenery,
grown so monotonous to some of the travellers,
and admired every little white and green town at
which they paused.</p>

<p>Donald put her into a carriage when they
reached the shore. Half an hour off they had
begun to smell the sea, and to catch glimpses of
low-lying marshes and a misty blueness against
the sky. Now every friendly hackman at the
station seemed a part of the great day to Aunt
Crete. So pretty a carriage, with low steps and
gray cushions and a fringe all around the canopy,
and a white speckled horse, with long, gentle,
white eyelashes. Aunt Crete leaned back self-consciously
on the gray cushions, and enjoyed the
creak of her silk jacket as she settled into place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
She felt as if this was a play that would soon be
over; but she would enjoy it to the very end, and
then go back to her dish-washing and cellar-cleaning,
and being blamed, and bear them all in
happy remembrance of what she had had for one
blissful vacation.</p>

<p>She did not know that Donald had telephoned
ahead for the best apartments in the hotel. She
was engaged in watching for the first blue line
of the great mysterious ocean; and, when it came
into sight, billowing suddenly above the line of
board walk as they turned a corner, her heart
stood still for one moment, and then bounded onward
set to the time of wonder.</p>

<p>Two obsequious porters jumped to assist Aunt
Crete from the carriage. The hand-baggage
drifted up the steps as if by magic, and awaited
them in the apartments to which they arose in a
luxurious elevator. Aunt Crete noticed several
old ladies with pink and blue wool knitting, sitting
in a row of large rocking-chairs, as she glided up
to the second floor. It gave her rest on one point,
for they all wore white dresses. She had been a
little dubious about those white dresses that
Donald had insisted upon. But now she might
enjoy them unashamed. O, what would Luella say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>She glanced around the room, half-fearfully
expecting to find Luella waiting there. Somehow,
now she was here, she wanted to get used to it
and enjoy it all before Luella came. For Luella
was an uncertain quantity. Luella might not like
it, after all! Dreadful thought! And after Donald
had taken so much trouble and spent so much
money all to surprise them!</p>

<p>The smiling porter absorbed the goodly tip that
Donald handed him, and went his way. Aunt
Crete and Donald were left alone. They looked
at each other and smiled.</p>

<p>“Let’s look around and see where they’ve put
us,” said Donald, pushing the swaying curtains
aside; and there before them rolled the blue tide
of the ocean. Aunt Crete sank into a chair, and
was silent for a while; and then she said: “It’s
just as big as I thought it would be. I was so
afraid it wouldn’t be. Some folks next door went
down to the shore last year, and they said it didn’t
look big enough to what they’d expected; and I’ve
been afraid ever since.”</p>

<p>Donald’s eyes filled with a tender light that was
beautiful to see. He was enjoying the spending
of his money, and it was yielding him a rich reward
already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The apartments that had been assigned to them
consisted of a parlor and two large bedrooms with
private baths. Donald discovered a few moments
later, when he went down to the office to investigate,
that Luella and his aunt occupied a single
room on the fourth floor back, overlooking the
kitchen court. It was not where he would have
placed them, had they chosen to await his coming
and be taken down to the shore in style. But now
that they had run away from him, and were too
evidently ashamed of him, perhaps it was as well
to let them remain where they were, he reflected.</p>

<p>“Aunt Carrie and Luella have gone out with a
party in a carriage for an all-day drive to Pleasure
Bay,” announced Donald when he came up.
“Aunt Carrie’s ankle must be better.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s real nice!” exclaimed Aunt Crete
with a smile, turning from her view of the sea,
where she had been ever since he left her. “I’m
glad Luella is having a good time, and we sha’n’t
miss her a mite. You and I’ll have the ocean all
to ourselves to-day.”</p>

<p>Donald smiled approvingly. He was not altogether
sure he cared to meet that other aunt and
cousin at all. He was not sure but he would like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to run away from them, and carry Aunt Crete
with him.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said, “I’m glad you’re not disappointed.
We’ll do just whatever we want to.
Would you like to go in bathing?”</p>

<p>“O, my! Could I? I’ve always thought I’d like
to see how it would feel, but I guess I’m too old.
Besides, there’s my figger. It wouldn’t look nice
in a bathing-suit. Luella wouldn’t like it a bit,
and I don’t want to disgrace her, now I’m here.
She always makes a lot of fun of old people going
in and sitting right on the edge of the water. I
guess it won’t do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it will do, if you want to. Didn’t I tell
you this was my party, and Luella isn’t in it?
That’s ridiculous. I’ll take you in myself, Aunt
Crete, and we’ll have the best time out; and you
sha’n’t be scared, either. I can swim like a fish.
You shall go in every day. Would you like to begin
at once?”</p>

<p>“I should,” said Aunt Crete, rising with a look
of resolution in her face. She felt that Luella
would condemn the amusement for her; so, if she
was to dare it, it must be done before her niece
appeared.</p>

<p>They went down to the beach, and for a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
minutes surveyed the bathers as they came out
to the water. Then with joy and daring in her
face Aunt Crete went into the little bath-house
with wildly beating heart, arrayed herself in the
gay blue flannel garb provided for her use, and
came timidly out to meet Donald, tall and smiling
in his blue jerseys.</p>

<p>They had a wonderful time. It was almost
better than shopping. Donald led her down to
the water, and very gently accustomed her to it
until he had led her out beyond the roughness,
where his strong arms lifted her well above the
swells until she felt as if she was a bird. It was
marvellous that she was not afraid, but she was
not. It was as if she had that morning been
transferred back over forty years to her youth
again, and was having the good times that she had
longed for, such as other girls had—the swings,
and the rides, and the skatings, and bicyclings.
How many such things she had watched through
the years, with her heart palpitating with daring
to do it all herself! Her petulant sister and the
logy Luella never dreamed that Aunt Crete desired
such un-auntly indulgences. If they had,
they would have taken it out of her, scorched it
out with scorn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The white hair with its natural waves fluffed
out beautifully, like a canary’s feathers, after the
bath, and Aunt Crete was smiling and charming
at lunch in one of her fine new white dresses. She
had hurried to put it on before Luella appeared,
lest they might all be spirited away from her if
Luella discovered them. She reflected with a sigh
that they would likely fit Luella beautifully, and
that that would probably be their final destination,
just as Luella’s discarded garments came to her.</p>

<p>But there was nothing to mar the lunch-time
and the beautiful afternoon, wherein, after a delicious
nap to the accompaniment of the music of
the waves, she was taken to drive in the fringed
carriage again, while a bunch of handsome ladies,
old and young, sat on the hotel piazza in more of
those abundant rockers, and watched her approvingly.
She felt that she was of some importance
in their eyes. She had suddenly blossomed out of
her insignificance, and was worth looking at. It
warmed her heart with humble pleasure. She
felt that she had won approval, not through any
merit of her own, but through Donald’s loving-kindness.
It was wonderful what a charm clothes
could work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Put on your gray silk for dinner,” said Donald
with malice aforethought in his heart.</p>

<p>“O,” gasped Aunt Crete, “I think I ought to
keep that for parties, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“If ever there was a party, it’s going to be to-night,”
said Donald. “It’s going to be a surprise-party.
You want to see if Aunt Carrie and Luella
will know you, you know.”</p>

<p>So with trembling fingers Aunt Crete arrayed
herself in her purple and fine linen, very materially
assisted by a quiet maid, whom Donald had
ordered sent to the room, and who persuaded Aunt
Crete to let her arrange the pretty white hair.</p>

<p>It was surprising to see, when the coiffure was
complete, that she looked quite like the other old
ladies, who were not old at all, only playing old.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they will know me,” whispered
Aunt Crete to herself as she stood before the full-length
mirror and surveyed the effect. “And I
didn’t think I could ever look like that!” she murmured
after a more prolonged gaze, during which
she made the acquaintance of her new self. Then
she added half wistfully: “I wish I had known it
before. I think perhaps they’d have—liked me—more
if I’d looked that way all the time.” She
sighed half regretfully, as if she were bidding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
good-by to this new vision, and went out to Donald,
who awaited her. She felt that the picnic part of
her vacation was almost over now, for Carrie and
Luella would be sure to manage to spoil it someway.</p>

<p>Donald looked up from his paper with a welcome
in his eyes. It was the first time she had
seen him in evening dress, and she thought him
handsome as a king.</p>

<p>“You’re a very beautiful woman, Aunt Crete;
do you know it?” said Donald with satisfaction.
He had felt that the French maid would know how
to put just the right touch to Aunt Crete’s pretty
hair to take away her odd, “unused” appearance.
Now she was completely in the fashion, and she
looked every inch a lady. She somehow seemed
to have natural intuition for gentle manners. Perhaps
her kindly heart dictated them, for surely
there can be no better manners than come
wrapped up with the Golden Rule, and Aunt Crete
had lived by that all her life.</p>

<p>They entered the great dining-hall, and made
their way among the palms in a blaze of electric
light, with the head waiter bowing obsequiously
before them. They had a table to themselves, and
Aunt Crete rejoiced in the tiny shaded candles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the hothouse roses in the centre, and lifted the
handsome napkins and silver forks with awe.
Sometimes it seemed as if she were still dreaming.</p>

<p>The party from Pleasure Bay had reached home
rather late in the afternoon, after a tedious time
in the hot sun at a place full of peanut-stands and
merry-go-rounds and moving-picture shows.
Luella had not had a good time. She had been disappointed
that none of the young men in the party
had paid her special attention. In fact, the special
young man for whose sake she had prodded her
mother into going had not accompanied them at
all. Luella was thoroughly cross.</p>

<p>“Mercy, how you’ve burned your nose, Luella!”
said her mother sharply. “It’s so unbecoming.
The skin is all peeling off. I do wish you’d wear a
veil. You can’t afford to lose your complexion,
with such a figure as you have.”</p>

<p>“O, fiddlesticks! I wish you’d let up on that,
ma,” snapped Luella. “Didn’t you get a letter
from Aunt Crete? I wonder what she’s thinking
about not to send that lavender organdie. I
wanted to wear it to-night. There’s to be a hop
in the ballroom, and that would be just the thing.
She ought to have got it done; she’s had time
enough since I telephoned. I suppose she’s gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to reading again. I do wish I’d remembered to
lock up the bookcase. She’s crazy for novels.”</p>

<p>All this time Luella was being buttoned into a
pink silk muslin heavily decorated with cheap lace.
There were twenty-six tiny elusive buttons, and
Luella’s mother was tired.</p>

<p>“What on earth makes you so long, ma?” snarled
Luella, twisting her neck to try to see her back.
“We’ll be so late we won’t get served, and I’m hungry
as a bear.”</p>

<p>They hurried down, arriving at the door just as
Aunt Crete and Donald were being settled into
their chairs by the smiling head waiter.</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake! those must be swells,” said
Luella in a low tone. “Did you see how that waiter
bowed and smiled? He never does that to us. I
expect he got a big tip. See, they’re sitting right
next our table. Goodness, ma, your hair is all
slipped to one side. Put it up quick. No, the
other side. Say, he’s an awfully handsome young
man. I wonder if we can get introduced. I just
know he dances gracefully. Say, mother, I’d like
to get him for a partner to-night. I guess those
stuck-up Grandons would open their eyes then.”</p>

<p>“Hush, Luella; he’ll hear you.”</p>

<p>They settled into their places unassisted by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
dilatory waiter, who came languidly up a moment
later to take their order.</p>

<p>Aunt Crete’s back was happily toward her relatives,
and so she ate her dinner in comfort. The
palms were all about, and the gentle clink of silver
and glass, and refined voices. The soft strains
of an orchestra hidden in a balcony of ferns and
palms drowned Luella’s strident voice when it was
raised in discontented strain, and so Aunt Crete
failed to recognize the sound. But Donald had
been on the alert. In the first place, he had asked
a question or two, and knew about where his relatives
usually sat, and had purposely asked to be
placed near them. He studied Luella when she
came in, and felt pretty sure she was the girl he
had seen on the platform of the train the morning
he arrived in Midvale; and finally in a break in the
music he distinctly caught the name “Luella” from
the lips of the sour woman in the purple satin with
white question-marks all over it and plasters of
white lace.</p>

<p>Aunt Carrie was tall and thin, with a discontented
droop to her lips, and premature wrinkles.
She wore an affected air of abnormal politeness
and disapproval of everything. She was studying
the silver-gray silk back in front of her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
wondering what there was about that elegant-looking
woman with the lovely white waved pompadour
and puffs, and that exquisite real lace collar,
to remind her of poor sister Lucretia. She
always coupled the adjective “poor” with her sister’s
name when she thought of all her shortcomings.</p>

<p>Luella’s discontent was somewhat enlivened by
the sight of the young man that had not gone on
the drive to Pleasure Bay. He stood in the doorway,
searching the room with keen, interested
eyes. Could it be that he was looking for her?
Luella’s heart leaped in a moment’s triumph. Yes,
he seemed to be looking that way as if he had
found the object of his search, and he was surely
coming down toward them with a real smile on his
face. Luella’s face broke into preparatory smiles.
She would be very coy, and pretend not to see him;
so she began a voluble and animated conversation
with her mother about the charming time they had
had that day, which might have surprised the
worthy woman if she had not been accustomed to
her daughter’s wiles. She knew it to be a warning
of the proximity of some one that Luella
wished to charm.</p>

<p>The young man came on straight by the solicitous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
waiters, who waved him frantically to various
tables. Luella cast a rapid side glance, and talked
on gayly with drooping head and averted gaze.
Her mother looked up, wondering, to see what was
the cause of Luella’s animation. He was quite
near now, and in a moment more he would speak.
The girl felt excited thrills creeping up her back,
and the color rushed into her cheeks, which were
already red enough from the wind and sun of the
day.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said the young man’s voice in a
hearty eagerness Luella had never hoped to hear
addressed to herself, “this is too good to be true.
Don, old man, where did you drop from? I saw
your name in the register, and rushed right into
the dining-room——”</p>

<p>“Clarence Grandon, as true as I live!” said a
pleasant voice behind Luella. “I thought you were
in Europe, bless your heart. This is the best thing
that could have happened. Let me introduce my
aunt——”</p>

<p>Some seconds before this Luella’s thrills had
changed to chills. Mortification stole over her
face and up to the roots of her hair. Even the
back of her neck, where her bathing-suit was cut
low and square, turned angry-looking. The pink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
muslin had a round neck, and showed a half-circle
of whiter neck below the bathing-suit square. But
Luella had the presence of mind to smile on to her
mother in mild pretence that she had but just
noticed the advent of the young man behind. An
obsequious waiter was bringing an extra chair for
Mr. Grandon, and he was to be seated so that he
could look toward their table. Perhaps he would
recognize her yet, and there might be a chance of
introduction to the handsome stranger. Luella
dallied with her dinner in fond hope, and her
mother aided and abetted her.</p>

<p>The lovely old lady with the silver-gray silk and
the real lace collar and beautiful hair had her back
squarely toward the table where Luella and her
mother sat. They could not see her face. They
could only notice how interested both the young
men were in her, and how courteous they were to
her; and they decided she must be some very great
personage indeed. They watched her half enviously,
and began to plan some way to scrape an
acquaintance with her. One glimpse they had of
her face as the head waiter rushed to draw back
her chair when she had finished her dinner. It
was a fine, handsome face, younger than they had
expected to see, with beautiful sparkling eyes full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of mirth and contentment. What was there in the
face that reminded them of something? Had they
ever met that old lady before?</p>

<p>Luella and her mother brought their dallied dessert
to a sudden ending, and followed hard upon
the footsteps of the three down the length of the
dining-hall; but the lady in gray and her two attendants
had disappeared already, and disconsolately
they lingered about, looking up and down
the length of piazzas in vain hope to see them sitting
in one of the great rows of rockers, watching
the many-tinted waves in the dying evening light;
but there was no sign of them anywhere.</p>

<p>As they stood thus leaning over the balcony, a
large automobile, gray, with white cushions, like
a great gliding dove, slipped silently up to the entrance
below them in the well-bred silence that an
expensive machine knows how to assume under
dignified owners.</p>

<p>Luella twitched her mother’s sleeve. “That’s
Grandon’s car,” she whispered. “P’raps I’ll get
asked to go. Let’s sit down here and wait.”</p>

<p>The mother obediently sat down.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V<br /><br />

<small>LUELLA AND HER MOTHER ARE MYSTIFIED</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> had not long to wait. They heard the elevator
door slide softly open, and then the gentle
swish of silken skirts. Luella looked around just
in time to be recognized by young Mr. Grandon
if he had not at that moment been placing a long
white broadcloth coat about his mother’s shoulders.
There were four in the party, and Luella’s
heart sank. He would not be likely to ask another
one. The young man and the gray-silk, thread-lace
woman from the other dining-table were going
with them, it appeared. Young Mr. Grandon
helped the gray-silk lady down the steps while the
handsome stranger walked by Mrs. Grandon.
They did not look around at the people on the
piazza at all. Luella bit her lips in vexation.</p>

<p>“For pity’s sake, Luella, don’t scowl so,” whispered
her mother; “they might look up yet and see
you.”</p>

<p>This warning came just in time; for young Mr.
Grandon just as he was about to start the car
glanced up, and, catching Luella’s fixed gaze, gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
her a distant bow, which was followed by a courteous
lifting of the stranger’s hat.</p>

<p>Aunt Crete was seated beside Mrs. Grandon in
the back seat and beaming her joy quietly. She
was secretly exulting that Luella and Carrie had
not been in evidence yet. She felt that her joy
was being lengthened by a few minutes more, for
she could not get away from the fear that her
sister and niece would spoil it all as soon as they
appeared upon the scene.</p>

<p>“I thought Aunt Carrie and Luella would be
tired after their all-day trip, and we wouldn’t disturb
them to-night,” said Donald in a low tone,
looking back to Aunt Crete as the car glided
smoothly out from the shelter of the wide piazza.</p>

<p>Aunt Crete smiled happily back to Donald, and
raised her eyes with a relieved glance toward the
rows of people on the piazza. She had been afraid
to look her fill before lest she should see Luella
frowning at her somewhere; but evidently they
had not got back yet, or perhaps had not finished
their dinner.</p>

<p>As Aunt Crete raised her eyes, Luella and her
mother looked down into her upturned face enviously,
but Aunt Crete’s gaze had but just grazed
them and fallen upon an old lady of stately mien<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
with white, fluffy hair like her own, and a white
crêpe de chine gown trimmed with much white
lace. In deep satisfaction Aunt Crete reflected
that, if Luella had aught to say against her aunt’s
wearing modest white morning-gowns, she would
cite this model, who was evidently an old aristocrat
if one might judge by her jewels and her general
make-up.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 398px;">
<img src="images/i-090.jpg" width="398" height="500" alt="Carrie and Luella looking off porch at woman in car" />
<div class="caption">“‘SOMEWHERE I HAVE SEEN THAT WOMAN,’
EXCLAIMED LUELLA’S MOTHER”</div>
</div>

<p>“Somewhere I’ve seen that woman with the
gray silk!” exclaimed Luella’s mother suddenly as
Aunt Crete swept by. “There’s something real
familiar about the set of her shoulders. Look at
the way she raises her hand to her face. My
land! I believe she reminds me of your Aunt
Crete!”</p>

<p>“Now, mother!” scorned Luella. “As if Aunt
Crete could ever look like that! You must be
crazy to see anything in such an elegant lady to
remind you of poor old Aunt Crete. Why, ma,
this woman is the real thing! Just see how her
hair’s put up. Nobody but a French maid could
get it like that. Imagine Aunt Crete with a French
maid. O, I’d die laughing. She’s probably
washing our country cousin’s supper dishes at
this very minute. I wonder if her conscience
doesn’t hurt her about my lavender organdie. Say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
ma, did you notice how graceful that handsome
stranger was when he handed the ladies into the
car? My, but I’d like to know him. I think Clarence
Grandon is just a stuck-up prig.”</p>

<p>Her mother looked at her sharply.</p>

<p>“Luella, seems to me you change your mind a
good deal. If I don’t make any mistake, you
came down here so’s to be near him. What’s made
you change your mind? He doesn’t seem to go
with any other girls.”</p>

<p>“No, he just sticks by his mother every living
minute,” sighed Luella unhappily. “I do wish I
had that lavender organdie. I look better in that
than anything else I’ve got. I declare I think
Aunt Crete is real mean and selfish not to send it.
I’m going in to see if the mail has come; and, if
the organdie isn’t here, nor any word from Aunt
Crete, I’m going to call her up on the telephone
again.”</p>

<p>Luella vanished into the hotel office, and her
mother sat and rocked with puckered brows. She
very much desired a place in high society for
Luella, but how to attain it was the problem. She
had not been born for social climbing, and took
hardly to it.</p>

<p>Meantime the motor-car rolled smoothly over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the perfect roads, keeping always that wonderful
gleaming sea in sight; and Aunt Crete, serenely
happy, beamed and nodded to the pleasant chat
of Mrs. Grandon, and was so overpowered by her
surroundings that she forgot to be overpowered
by the grand Mrs. Grandon. As in a dream she
heard the kindly tone, and responded mechanically
to the questions about her journey and the
weather in the city, and how lovely the sea was
to-night; but, as she spoke the few words with her
lips, her soul was singing, and the words of its
song were these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Must I be carried to the skies</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">On flowery beds of ease,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">While others fought to win the prize</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And sailed through bloody seas?”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class='unindent'>And it seemed to her as they glided along the
palace-lined shore, with the rolling sea on one
hand, and the beautiful people in their beautiful
raiment at ease and happy on the other hand, that
she was picked right up out of the hot little brick
house in the narrow street, and put on a wonderfully
flowery bed of ease, and was floating right
into a heaven of which her precious Donald was a
bright, particular angel. She forgot all about
Luella and what she might say, and just enjoyed
herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>She even found herself telling the elegant Mrs.
Grandon exactly how she made piccalilli, and her
heart warmed to the other woman as she saw that
she was really interested. She had never supposed,
from the way in which Luella spoke of the
Grandons, that they would even deign to eat such
a common thing as a pickle, let alone knowing anything
about it. Aunt Crete’s decision was that
Mrs. Grandon wasn’t stuck up in the least, but just
a nice, common lady like any one; and, as she went
up in the elevator beside her, and said good-night,
she felt as if she had known her all her life.</p>

<p>It was not until she had turned out her light and
crept into the great hotel bed that it came to her
to wonder whether Luella and Carrie could be
meant by the ones in the hymn,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“While others fought to win the prize</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sailed through bloody seas.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>She couldn’t help feeling that perhaps she had
been selfish in enjoying her day so much when for
aught she knew Luella might not be having a good
time. For Luella not to have a good time meant
blame for her aunt generally. Ever since Luella
had been born it had been borne in upon Aunt
Crete that there was a moral obligation upon her
to make Luella have a good time. And now Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Crete was having a good time, the time of her life;
and she hugged herself, she was so happy over it,
and thought of the dear stars out there in the deep,
dark blue of the arching sky, and the cool, dark
roll of the white-tipped waves, and was thankful.</p>

<p>Luella and her mother had gloomily watched
the dancing through the open windows of the ballroom;
but, as they knew no one inside, they did
not venture in. Luella kept one eye out for the
return of the car, but somehow missed it, and finally
retired to the solace of cold-cream and the
comforts of the fourth floor back, where lingered
in the atmosphere a reminder of the dinner past
and a hint of the breakfast that was to come.</p>

<p>As the elevator ascended past the second floor,
the door of one of the special apartments stood
wide, revealing a glimpse of the handsome young
stranger standing under the chandelier reading a
letter, his face alive with pleasure. Luella sighed
enviously, and in her dreams strove vainly to enter
into the charmed circle where these favored beings
moved, and knew not that of her own free
will she had closed the door to that very special
apartment, which might have been hers but for
her own action.</p>

<p>The next morning Luella was twisting her neck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in a vain endeavor to set the string of artificial
puffs straight upon the enormous cushion of her
hair, till they looked for all the world like a pan
of rolls just out of the oven. She had jerked them
off four separate times, and pulled the rest of her
hair down twice in a vain attempt to get just the
desired effect; and her patience, never very great
at any time, was well-nigh exhausted. Her mother
was fretting because the best pieces of fish and
all the hot rolls would be gone before they got
down to breakfast, and Luella was snapping back
in most undaughterly fashion, when a noticeable
tap came on the door. It was not the tap of the
chambermaid of the fourth floor back, nor of the
elevator boy, who knew how to modulate his knock
for every grade of room from the second story,
ocean front, up and back. It was a knock of rare
condescension, mingled with a call to attention;
and it warned these favored occupants of room
410 to sit up and take notice, not that they were
worthy of any such consideration as was about
to fall upon them.</p>

<p>Luella drove the last hairpin into the puffs, and
sprang to the door just as her mother opened it.
She felt something was about to happen. Could it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
be that she was to be invited to ride in that automobile
at last, or what?</p>

<p>There in the hall, looking very much out of
place, and as if he hoped his condescension would
be appreciated, but he doubted it, stood the uniformed
functionary that usually confined his
activities to the second floor front, where the tips
were large and the guests of unquestioned wealth,
to say nothing of culture. He held in his hand a
shining silver tray on which lay two cards, and
he delivered his message in a tone that not only
showed the deference he felt for the one who had
sent him, but compelled such deference also on
the part of those to whom he spoke.</p>

<p>“De lady and gen’leman says, Will de ladies come
down to the private pahlah as soon aftah breakfus’
as is convenient, room number 2, second flo’
front?” He bowed to signify that his mission
was completed, and that if it did not carry
through, it was entirely beyond his sphere to do
more.</p>

<p>Luella grasped the cards and smothered an exclamation
of delight. “Second floor, front,” gasped
her mother. “The private parlor! Did you hear,
Luella?”</p>

<p>But Luella was standing by the one window,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
frowning over the cards. One was written and one
engraved, a lady’s and a gentleman’s cards. “Miss
Ward.” “Mr. Donald Ward Grant.”</p>

<p>“For the land’s sake, ma! Who in life are they?
Do you know any Miss Ward? You don’t s’pose
it’s that lovely gray-silk woman. Miss Ward.
Donald Ward Grant. Who can they be, and what
do you suppose they want? Grant. Donald Grant.
Where have I, why—! O, horrors, ma! It can’t be
that dreadful cousin has followed us up, can it?
Donald Grant is his name, of course; yes, Donald
Ward Grant. It was the Ward that threw me off.
But who is the other? Miss Ward. Ma! You
don’t——!”</p>

<p>“Luella Burton, that’s just what it is! It’s your
Aunt Crete and that dreadful cousin. Crete never
did have any sense, if she is my sister. But just
let me get speech of her! If I don’t make her
writhe. I think I’ll find a way to make her understand——”</p>

<p>Luella’s expansive bravery beneath the row of
biscuit puffs seemed to shrink and cringe as she
took in the thought.</p>

<p>“O ma!” she groaned. “How could she? And
here of all places! To come here and mortify me!
It is just too dreadful. Ma, it can’t be true. Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Crete would never dare. And where would she
get the money? She hasn’t a cent of her own, has
she? You didn’t go and leave her money, did
you?”</p>

<p>“No, only a little change in my old pocketbook; it
wouldn’t have been enough to come down here on,
unless she bought a day excursion. Wait. I did
leave five dollars to pay the grocer bill with. But
Crete surely wouldn’t take that. Still, there’s no
telling. She always was a kind of a child. O, dear!
What shall we do?” The mother sat down on the
tumbled bed beside the tray of Luella’s cheap
trunk.</p>

<p>“Well, we must do something, that’s certain, if
we have to run away again. It would never do to
have those two appear here now. Mercy! think
of Aunt Crete in her old black and white silk sitting
next table to that lovely lady in gray. I should
simply sink through the floor.”</p>

<p>“We can’t run away, Luella,” snapped the practical
mother. “We’ve paid for our room two weeks
ahead. I didn’t want to do that; but you thought
if Aunt Crete should get any nonsense into her
head about our coming home, we could tell we’d
paid for the room, and that would settle it with
her. So now it’s done, and we can’t afford not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
abide by it. Besides, what good would that do?
We couldn’t afford to go anywhere but home, and
that would be as bad as it was in the first place.
We’ve got to think it out. If I just had hold of
Crete a minute, I’d make her fix it up. She’d have
to think some way out of it herself without any of
my help, to pay her for her stupidity in coming. I
can’t understand how she’d do it.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think she’d dare!” glared Luella with
no pleasant expression on her face.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we’ll have to do, Luella,” said
her mother. “We’ll slip down those stairs in the
back hall. I went down one day, and they go right
out on the piazza that runs in front of the dining-room.
We’ll just slip in the back door, and get
our breakfast right away. It’s getting pretty late.
You better hurry. They’ve likely come up from
town on that very early train, and they’ll sit and
wait for us. We’ll ring for a messenger bell-boy,
and send down a note that my ankle is so much
worse I can’t come down-stairs, and you can’t
leave me. We’ll say: ‘Mrs. Burton and Miss Burton
regret that they cannot come down as requested;
but Mrs. Burton is confined to her bed
by a sprained ankle, and her daughter cannot leave
her. Miss Ward will have to come up.’ You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
write it on one of your visiting-cards, Luella, and
we’ll send it down as quick as we get back from
breakfast. Hurry up. The only thing about it
will be that climb up three flights after breakfast,
but it won’t do for us to risk the elevator. Crete
might recognize us, for the elevator goes right by
that second-floor front parlor. What I don’t understand
is how they got in there. It’s only rich
people can afford that. But, land! Crete’s just
like a baby; hasn’t been out in the world ever; and
very likely she never asked how much the rooms
were, but just took the best she could lay eyes on.
Or more likely it’s a mistake, and she’s sitting in
that little reception-room down on the office floor,
and thinks it the second floor because she came up
such a long flight of steps from the sidewalk. We’ll
have to tell the bell-boy to hunt up the fellow that
brought up their cards, and take it to the same
folks. Come on now, Luella, and go slow when
you turn corners. There’s no telling but they
might be prowling round trying to hunt us; so
keep a lookout.”</p>

<p>Thus by devious and back ways they descended
to a late breakfast, and scuttled up again without
being molested.</p>

<p>Luella wrote the note on her card as her mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
dictated, and a small boy all brass buttons was
despatched with careful directions; and then
the two retired behind their ramparts, and
waited.</p>

<p>Time went by, until half an hour had elapsed
since they came back from breakfast. They had
listened anxiously to every footfall in the hall, and
part of the time Luella kept the door open a crack
with her ear to it. Their nerves were all in a
quiver. When the chambermaid arrived, they
were fairly feverish to get her out of the way. If
Aunt Crete should come while she was in the room,
it might get all over the hotel what kind of relatives
they had.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burton suggested to the chambermaid that
she leave their room till last, as they wanted to
write some letters before going out; but the maid
declared she must do the room at once or not at
all. The elevator slid up and down around the
corner in the next hall. They heard a footfall
now and then, but none that sounded like Aunt
Crete’s. They rang again for the office-boy, who
declared he had delivered the message in the
second floor, front, and that the lady and gentleman
were both in and said, “All right.” He vanished
impudently without waiting for Luella’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
probing questions, and they looked at each other
in anxiety and indignation.</p>

<p>“It is too mean, ma, to lose this whole morning.
I wanted to go in bathing,” complained Luella,
“and now no telling how long I’ll have to stick in
this dull room. I wish Aunt Crete was in Halifax.
Why couldn’t I have had some nice relatives
like that lovely old gray-silk lady and her son?”</p>

<p>Just then the elevator clanged open and shut,
and steps came down the hall. It certainly was
not Aunt Crete. Luella flew to the door at the
first tap; and there, submerged in a sheaf of
American Beauty roses, stood the functionary
from the lower floor, with a less pompous manner
than he had worn before. The roses had caused
his respect for the occupants of the fourth floor,
back, to rise several degrees.</p>

<p>Luella stood speechless in wonder, looking first
at the roses and then at the servant. Such roses
had never come into her life before. Could it be—must
it be—but a miserable mistake?</p>

<p>Then the servant spoke.</p>

<p>“Miss Ward sends de flowers, an’ is sorry de
ladies ain’t well. She send her regrets, an’ says
she can’t come to see de ladies ’count of a drive
she’d promised to take to-day, in which she’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
hoped to have de ladies’ comp’ny. She hopes de
ladies be better dis even’n’.”</p>

<p>He was gone, and the mother and daughter
faced each other over the roses, bewilderment and
awe in their faces.</p>

<p>“<i>What</i> did he say, Luella? <i>Who</i> sent those
roses? Miss <i>Ward</i>? Luella, there’s some mistake.
Aunt Crete couldn’t have sent them. She
wouldn’t <i>dare</i>! Besides, where would she get the
money? It’s perfectly impossible. It can’t be
Aunt Crete, after all. It must be some one else
with the same name. Perhaps Donald has picked
up some one here in the hotel; you can’t tell; or
perhaps it isn’t our Donald at all. It’s likely
there’s other Donald Grants in the world. What
we ought to have done was to go down at once and
find out, and not skulk in a corner. But you’re
always in such a hurry to do something, Luella.
There’s no telling at all who this is now. It might
be those folks you admired so much, though what
on earth they should have sent their cards to us
for—and those lovely roses—I’m sure I don’t
know.”</p>

<p>“Now, ma, you needn’t blame me. It was you
proposed sending that note down; you know it
was, mother; and of course I had to do what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
said. I was so upset, anyway, I didn’t know what
was what. But now, you see, perhaps you’ve cut
me out of a lovely day. We might have gone on
a ride with them.”</p>

<p>“Luella,” her mother broke in sharply, “if you
talk another word like that, I’ll take the next train
back home. You don’t know what you are talking
about. It may be Aunt Crete, after all, and
a country cousin for all you know; and, if it is,
would you have wanted to go driving in the face
of the whole hotel, with like as not some old shin-and-bones
horse and a broken-down carriage?”</p>

<p>Luella was silenced for the time, and the room
settled into gloomy meditation.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI<br /><br />

<small>AN EMBARRASSING MEETING</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Meantime</span> Aunt Crete in the whitest of her
white was settling herself comfortably on the
gray cushions of the fringed phaeton again, relief
and joy mingled in her countenance. It was not
that she was glad that Carrie’s ankle was so bad,
but that she was to have another short reprieve
before her pleasure was cut off. Soon enough,
she thought, would she be destined to sit in the
darkened room and minister to her fussy sister,
while Luella took her place in the carriages and
automobiles with her handsome young cousin, as
young folks should do, of course; but O, it was
good, good, that a tired old lady, who had worked
hard all her life, could yet have had this bit of a
glimpse of the brighter side of life before she died.</p>

<p>It would be something to sit and think over as
she scraped potatoes for dinner, or picked over
blackberries for jam, or patiently sewed on Val
lace for Luella. It would be an event to date from,
and she could fancy herself mildly saying to Mrs.
Judge Waters, when she sat beside her some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
at missionary meeting, if she ever did again,
“When my nephew took me down to the shore,”
etc. She never knew just what to talk about when
she sat beside Mrs. Judge Waters, but here was a
topic worth laying before such a great lady.</p>

<p>Well, it was something to be thankful for, and
she resolved she just would not think of poor
Carrie and Luella until her beautiful morning
was over. Then she would show such patience
and gratitude as would fully make up to them for
her one more day of pleasure.</p>

<p>It was Donald, of course, who had suggested the
roses. When the message came from the fourth
floor back, Aunt Crete had turned white about the
mouth, and her eyes had taken on a frightened,
hunted look, while the double V in her forehead
flashed into sight for the first time since they had
reached the Atlantic coast. He saw at once in
what terror Aunt Crete held her sister and niece,
and his indignation arose in true Christian fashion.
He resolved to place some nice hot coals
on the heads of his unpleasant relatives, and run
away with dear Aunt Crete again; hence the roses
and the message, and Aunt Crete was fairly childish
with pleasure over them when he finally persuaded
her that it would be all right to send these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
in place of going up herself as she had been
bidden.</p>

<p>She listened eagerly as Donald gave careful
directions for the message, and the stately functionary
respectfully repeated the words with his
own high-sounding inflection. It made the pink
come and go again in Aunt Crete’s cheeks, and
she felt that Luella and Carrie could not be angry
with her after these roses, and especially when
everything was being done up in so nice, stylish
a manner.</p>

<p>The drive was one long dream of bliss to Aunt
Crete. They went miles up the coast, and took
lunch at a hotel much grander than the one they
had left, so that when they returned in the afternoon
Aunt Crete felt much less awe of the Traymore,
her experience in hotels having broadened.
They also met some friends of Donald’s, a professor
from his alma mater, who with his wife
was just returning from a trip to Europe.</p>

<p>The bathers were making merry in the waves
as they returned, and Aunt Crete’s wistful look
made Donald ask whether she felt too tired to take
another dip, but she declared she was not one bit
tired.</p>

<p>She came from her bath with shining eyes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
triumphant mien. Whatever happened now, she
had been in bathing twice. She felt like quite an
experienced bather, and she could dream of that
wonderful experience of being lifted high above
the swells in Donald’s strong young arms.</p>

<p>She obediently took her nap, and surrendered
herself to the hands of the maid to have the finishing
touches put to her toilet. It was the soft gray
voile that she elected to wear to-night, and Donald
admired her when she emerged from her room in
the dress, looking every inch a lady.</p>

<p>A knock sounded at the door before he had had
time to give Aunt Crete a word of his admiration;
but his eyes had said enough, and she felt a glow
of humble pride in her new self, the self that he
had created out of what she had always considered
an unusually plain old woman. With the
consciousness of her becoming attire upon her
she turned with mild curiosity to see who had
knocked; and, behold, her sister and niece stood
before her!</p>

<p>The day had been passed by them in melancholy
speculations and the making and abandoning of
many plans of procedure. After careful deliberation
they at last concluded that there was nothing
to be done but go down and find out who these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
people really were, and if possible allay the ghost
of their fears and set themselves free from their
dull little room.</p>

<p>“If it should be Aunt Crete and Donald, we’ll
just settle them up and send them off at once,
won’t we, mother?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Mrs. Burton with an angry
snap to her eyes. “Trust me to settle with your
Aunt Crete if it’s really her. But I can’t think it
is. It isn’t like Crete one bit to leave her duty.
She’s got a lot of work to do, and she never leaves
her work till it’s done. It must be some one else.
What if it should be those folks you admire so
much? I’ve been thinking. We had some New
York cousins by the name of Ward. It might be
one of them, and Donald might have gone to them
first, and they’ve brought him down here. I can’t
think he’s very much, though. But we’ll just hope
for the best, anyway, till we find out. If it’s Aunt
Crete, I shall simply talk to her till she is brought
to her senses, and make her understand that she’s
got to go right home. I’ll tell her how she’s mortifying
you, and spoiling your chances of a good
match, perhaps——”</p>

<p>“O ma!” giggled Luella in admiration.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell her she must tell Donald she’s got to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
go right home, that the sea air don’t agree with
her one bit—it goes to her head or something like
that; and then we’ll make him feel it wouldn’t be
gallant in him not to take her home. That’s easy enough,
if ’tis them.”</p>

<p>“But ma, have you thought about your sprained
ankle? How’ll they think you got over so quick?
S’posing it shouldn’t be Aunt Crete.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell her the swelling’s gone down, and
all of a sudden something seemed to slip back into
place again, and I’m all right.”</p>

<p>This was while they were buttoning and hooking
each other into their best and most elaborate
garments for the peradventure that the people
they were to meet might prove to be of patrician
class.</p>

<p>They had been somewhat puzzled how to find
their possible relatives after they were attired for
the advance on the enemy, but consultation with
the functionary in the office showed them that,
whoever Miss Ward and Donald Grant might be,
they surely were at present occupying the apartments
on the second floor front.</p>

<p>For one strenuous moment after the elevator
had left them before the door of the private parlor
they had carefully surveyed each other, fastening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a stubborn hook here, putting up a stray rebellious
lock there, patting a puff into subordination. Mrs.
Burton was arrayed in an elaborate tucked and
puffed and belaced lavender muslin whose laborious
design had been attained through hours of the
long winter evenings past. Luella wore what she
considered her most “fetching” garment, a long,
scant, high-waisted robe of fire-red crape, with
nothing to relieve its glare, reflected in staring
hues in her already much-burned nose and cheeks.
Her hair had been in preparation all the afternoon,
and looked as if it was carved in waves and
puffs out of black walnut, so closely was it beset
with that most noticeable of all invisible devices,
an invisible net.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 402px;">
<img src="images/i-113.jpg" width="402" height="500" alt="Crete and Donal meet Carrie and Luella face to face" />
<div class="caption">“THEY STOOD FACE TO FACE WITH THE WONDERFUL
LADY IN THE GRAY GOWN”</div>
</div>

<p>They entered, and stood face to face with the
wonderful lady in the gray gown, whose every line
and graceful fold spoke of the skill of a foreign
tailor. And then, strange to say, it was Aunt
Crete who came to herself first.</p>

<p>Perfectly conscious of her comely array, and
strong in the strength of her handsome nephew
who stood near to protect, she suddenly lost all
fear of her fretful sister and bullying niece, and
stepped forward with an unconscious grace of
welcome that must have been hers all the time, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
it never would have come to the front in this
crisis.</p>

<p>“Why, here you are at last, Luella! How nice
you look in your red crape! Why, Carrie, I’m
real glad you’ve got better so you could come
down. How is your ankle? And here is Donald.
Carrie, can’t you see Hannah’s looks in him?”</p>

<p>Amazement and embarrassment struggled in
the faces of mother and daughter. They looked
at Aunt Crete, and they looked at Donald, and
then they looked at Aunt Crete again. It couldn’t
be, it wasn’t, yet it was, the voice of Aunt Crete,
kind and forgiving, and always thoughtful for
every one, yet with a new something in it. Or
was it rather the lack of something? Yes, that
was it, the lack of a certain servile something that
neither Luella nor her mother could name, yet
which made them feel strangely ill at ease with
this new-old Aunt Crete.</p>

<p>They looked at each other bewildered, and then
back at Aunt Crete again, tracing line by line the
familiar features in their new radiance of happiness,
and trying to conjure back the worried V
in her forehead, and the slinky sag of her old
gowns. Was the world turned upside down? What
had happened to Aunt Crete?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Upon my word, Lucretia Ward, is it really
you?” exclaimed her sister, making a wild dash
into the conversation, determined to right herself
and everything else if possible. She felt like a person
suddenly upset in a canoe, and she struggled
wildly to get her footing once more if there was
any solid footing anywhere, with her sister Crete
standing there calmly in an imported gown, her
hair done up like a fashion-plate, and a millionaire’s
smile on her pleasant face.</p>

<p>But Luella was growing angry. What did Aunt
Crete mean by masquerading round in that
fashion and making them ashamed before this
handsome young man? and was he really their
Western cousin? Luella felt that a joke was being
played upon her, and she always resented
jokes—at least, unless she played them herself.</p>

<p>Then Donald came to the front, for he feared
for Aunt Crete’s poise. She must not lose her
calm dignity and get frightened. There was a
sharp ring in the other aunt’s voice, and the new
cousin looked unpromising.</p>

<p>“And is this my Aunt Carrie? And my Cousin
Luella?” He stepped forward, and shook hands
pleasantly.</p>

<p>“I am glad to be able to speak with you at last,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
he said as he dropped Luella’s hand, “though it’s
not the first time I’ve seen you, nor heard your
voice, either, you know.”</p>

<p>Luella looked up puzzled, and tried to muster
her scattered graces, and respond with her ravishing
society air; but somehow the ease and grace
of the man before her overpowered her. And was
he really her cousin? She tried to think what he
could mean by having seen and talked with her
before. Surely he must be mistaken, or—perhaps
he was referring to the glimpse he had of her
when Mr. Grandon bowed the evening before. She
tossed her head with a kittenish movement, and
arched her poorly pencilled eyebrows.</p>

<p>“O, how is that?” she asked, wishing he had not
been quite so quick to drop her hand. It would
have been more impressive to have had him hold
it just a second longer.</p>

<p>“Why, I saw you the morning you left your
home, as I was getting out of the train. You were
just entering, and you called out of the window
to a young lady in a pony-cart. You wore a light
kind of a yellowish suit, didn’t you? Yes, I was
very sure it was you.”</p>

<p>He was studying her face closely, a curious
twinkle in his eyes, which might or might not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
have been complimentary. Luella could not be
sure. The color rose in her cheeks and neck and
up to her black-walnut hair till the red dress and
the red face looked all of a flame. She suddenly
remembered what she had called out to the young
lady in the pony-cart, and she wondered whether
he had heard or noticed.</p>

<p>“And then,” went on her handsome persecutor,
“I had quite a long talk with you over the telephone,
you know——”</p>

<p>“What!” gasped Luella. “Was that you? Why,
you must be mistaken; I never telephoned to you;
that is, I couldn’t get any one to the ’phone.”</p>

<p>“What’s all this about, Luella?” questioned her
mother sharply, but Donald interposed.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Aunt Carrie. We are so excited
over meeting you at last that we are forgetting to
be courteous.” He shoved forth a comfortable
chair for his aunt, and another for the blushing,
overwhelmed Luella; and then he took Aunt
Crete’s hands lovingly, and gently pushed her
backward into the most comfortable rocker in the
room. “It’s just as cheap to sit down, dear aunt,”
he said, smiling. “And you know you’ve had a
pretty full day, and must not get tired for to-night’s
concert at the Casino. Now, Aunt Carrie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
tell us about your ankle. How did you come to
sprain it so badly, and how did it get well so fast?
We were quite alarmed about you. Is it really
better? I am afraid you are taxing it too much
to have come down this evening. Much as we
wanted to see you, we could have waited until it
was quite safe for you to use it, rather than have
you run any risks.”</p>

<p>Then it was the mother’s turn to blush, and her
thin, somewhat colorless face grew crimson with
embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Why, I——” she began; “that is, Luella was
working over it, rubbing it with liniment, and all
of a sudden she gave it a sort of a little pull; and
something seemed to give way with a sharp pain,
and then it came all right as good as ever. It feels
a little weak, but I think by morning it’ll be all
right. I think some little bone got out of place,
and Luella pulled it back in again. My ankles have
always been weak, anyway. I suffer a great deal
with them in going about my work at home.”</p>

<p>“Why, Carrie,” said Aunt Crete, leaning forward
with troubled reproach in her face, “you
never complained about it.”</p>

<p>A dull red rolled over Mrs. Burton’s thin features
again, and receded, leaving her face pinched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and haggard-looking. She felt as if she were seeing
visions. This couldn’t be her own sister, all
dressed up so, and yet speaking in the old sympathetic
tone.</p>

<p>“O, I never complain, of course. It don’t do
any good.”</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by another
tap on the door. Donald opened it, and received
a large express package. While he was giving
some orders to the servant, Mrs. Burton leaned
forward, and said in a low tone to her sister:</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, Lucretia Ward, what does
all this mean? How ever did you get tricked out
like that?”</p>

<p>Then Donald’s clear voice broke in upon them as
the door closed once more, and Luella watched
him curiously cutting with eager, boyish haste the
cords of the express package.</p>

<p>“Aunt Crete, your cloak has come. Now we’ll
all see if it’s becoming.”</p>

<p>“Bless the boy,” said Aunt Crete, looking up
with delighted eyes. “Cloak; what cloak? I’m
sure I’ve got wraps enough now. There’s the cloth
coat, and the silk one, and that elegant black
lace——”</p>

<p>“No, you haven’t. I saw right off what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
needed when we went out in the auto last night;
and I telephoned to that Miss Brower up in the
city this morning, and she’s fixed it all up. I hope
you’ll like it.”</p>

<p>With that he pulled the cover off the box, and
brought to view a long, full evening cloak of pale
pearl-colored broadcloth lined with white silk, and
a touch about the neck of black velvet and handsome
creamy lace.</p>

<p>He held it up at arm’s length admiringly.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Aunt Crete. It looks just like
you. I knew that woman would understand. Stand
up, and let’s see how you look in it; and then after
dinner we’ll take a little spin around the streets
to try you in it.”</p>

<p>Aunt Crete, blushing like a pretty girl, stood
up; and he folded the soft garment about her in all
its elegant richness. She stood just in front of the
full-length mirror, and could not deny to herself
that it was becoming. But she was getting used
to seeing herself look well, and was not so much
overpowered with the sight as she was with the
tender thought of the boy that had got it for her.
She forgot Carrie and Luella, and everything but
that Donald had gone to great trouble and expense
to please her; and she just turned around,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and put her two hands, one on each of his cheeks,
standing on her tiptoes to reach him, and kissed
him.</p>

<p>He bent and returned the kiss laughingly.</p>

<p>“It’s lot of fun to get you things, Aunt Crete,”
he said; “you always like them so much.”</p>

<p>“It is beautiful, beautiful,” she said, looking
down and smoothing the cloth tenderly as if it had
been his cheek. “It’s much too beautiful for me.
Donald, you will spoil me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should think so,” sniffed Luella, as if
offering an apology in some sort for her childish
aunt.</p>

<p>“A little spoiling won’t hurt you, dear aunt,”
said Donald seriously. “I don’t believe you’ve
had your share of spoiling yet, and I mean to
give it to you if I can. Doesn’t she look pretty in
it, Cousin Luella? Come now, Aunt Carrie, I
suppose it’s time to go down to dinner, or we
sha’n’t get through in time for the fun. Are you
sure your ankle is quite well? Are you able to go
to the Casino to-night? I’ve tickets for us all.
Sousa’s orchestra is to be there, and the programme
is an unusually fine one.”</p>

<p>Luella was mortified and angry beyond words,
but a chance to go to the Casino, in company with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Clarence Grandon and his mother, was not to be
lightly thrown away; and she crushed down her
mortification, contenting herself with darting an
angry glance and a hateful curl of her lip at Aunt
Crete as they went out the door together. This,
however, was altogether lost on that little woman,
for she was watching her nephew’s face, and wondering
how it came that such joy had fallen to
her lot.</p>

<p>There was no chance for the mortified mother
and daughter to exchange a word as they went
down in the elevator or followed in the wake of
their relatives, before whom all porters and office-boys
and even head waiters bowed, and jumped
to offer assistance. They were having their wish,
to be sure, entering the dining-hall behind the
handsome young man and the elegant, gray-clad,
fashionably coiffured old lady, a part of the train,
with the full consciousness of “belonging,” yet in
what a way! Both were having ample opportunity
for reflection, for they could see at a glance
that no one noticed them, and all attention was for
those ahead of them.</p>

<p>Luella bit her lip angrily, and looked in wonder
at Aunt Crete, who somehow had lost her dumpiness,
and walked as gracefully beside her tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
young nephew as if she had been accustomed to
walk in the eyes of the world thus for years. The
true secret of her grace, if Luella had but known
it, was that she was not thinking in the least of
herself. Her conscience was at rest now, for the
meeting between the cousins was over, and Luella
was to have a good time too. Aunt Crete was
never the least bit selfish. It seemed to her that
her good time was only blooming into yet larger
things, after all.</p>

<p>Behind her walked her sister and niece in mortified
humiliation. Luella was trying to recall just
what she had said about “country cousins” over
the telephone, and exactly what she had said to
the girl in the pony-cart the morning she left
home. The memory did not serve to cool her
already heated complexion. It was beginning to
dawn upon her that she had made a mighty mistake
in running away from such a cousin and in
such a manner.</p>

<p>All her life, in such a case, Luella had been accustomed
to lay the blame of her disappointments
upon some one else, and vent, as it were, her spite
upon that one. Now, in looking about to find such
an object of blame her eyes naturally fell upon the
one that had borne the greater part of all blame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
for her. But, try as she would to pour out blame
and scorn from her large, bold eyes upon poor
Aunt Crete, somehow the blame seemed to slip
off from the sweet gray garments, and leave Aunt
Crete as serene as ever, with her eyes turned
trustingly toward her dear Donald. Luella was
brought to the verge of vexation by this, and could
scarcely eat any dinner.</p>

<p>The dessert was just being served when the
waiter brought Aunt Crete a dainty note from
which a faint perfume of violets stole across the
table to the knowing nostrils of Luella.</p>

<p>With the happy abandonment of a child Aunt
Crete opened it joyously.</p>

<p>“Who in the world can be writing to me?” she
said wonderingly. “You’ll have to read it for me,
Donald; I’ve left my glasses up in my room.”</p>

<p>Luella made haste to reach out her hand for the
note, but Donald had it first, as if he had not seen
her impatient hand claiming her right to read
Aunt Crete’s notes.</p>

<p>“It’s from Mrs. Grandon, auntie,” he said.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“‘<i>Dear Miss Ward</i>,’” he read, “‘I am sorry that I
am feeling too weary to go to the concert this evening
as we had planned, and my son makes such a baby of
me that he thinks he cannot leave me alone; but I do
hope we can have the pleasure of the company of yourself
and your nephew on a little auto trip to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
afternoon. My brother has a villa a few miles up
the shore, and he telephoned us this morning to dine
with them to-night. When he heard of your being
here, he said by all means to bring you with us. My
brother knows of your nephew’s intimacy with Clarence,
and is anxious to meet him, as are the rest of his
family. I do hope you will feel able to go with us.</p>

<p>“‘With sincere regrets that I cannot go with you to
the Casino this evening,</p>

<p class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Helen Grandon</span>.’”<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>For the moment Luella forgot everything else
in her amazement at this letter. Aunt Crete receiving
notes from Mrs. Grandon, from whom she
and her mother could scarcely get a frigid bow!
Aunt Crete invited on automobile trips and dinners
in villas! Donald an intimate friend of Clarence
Grandon’s! O, fool and blind! What had
she done! Or what had she undone? She studied
the handsome, keen face of her cousin as he bent
over the letter, and writhed to think of her own
words, “I’m running away from a backwoods
cousin”! She could hear it shouted from one end of
the great dining-hall to the other, and her face
blazed redder and redder till she thought it would
burst. Her mother turned from her in mortified
silence, and wondered why Luella couldn’t have
had a good complexion.</p>

<p>Studied politeness was the part that Donald had
set for himself that evening. He began to see
that his victims were sufficiently unhappy. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
had no wish to see them writhe under further tortures,
though when he looked upon Aunt Crete’s
happy face, and thought how white it had turned
at dread of them, he felt he must let the thorns he
had planted in their hearts remain long enough to
bring forth a true repentance. But he said nothing
further to distress them, and they began to
wonder whether, after all, he really had seen
through their plan of running away from him.</p>

<p>It was all Aunt Crete’s fault. She ought to have
arranged it in some way to get them quietly home
as soon as she found out what kind of cousin it
was that had come to see them. It never occurred
to Luella that nothing her poor, abused aunt could
have said would have convinced her that her
cousin was worthy of her home-coming.</p>

<p>As the concert drew near to its close, Luella and
her mother began to prepare for a time of reckoning
for Aunt Crete. When she was safely in her
room, what was to hinder them from going to her
alone and having it out? The sister’s face hardened,
and the niece’s eyes glittered as she stonily
thought of the scornful sentences she would hurl
after her aunt.</p>

<p>Donald looked at her menacing face, and read
its thoughts. He resolved to protect Aunt Crete,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
whatever came; so at the door, when he saw a motion
on his Aunt Crete’s part to pause, he said
gently: “Aunt Crete, I guess we’ll have to say
‘Good night’ now; for you’ve had a hard day of it,
and I want you to be bright and fresh for morning.
We want to take an early dip in the ocean.
The bathing-hours are early to-morrow, I see.”</p>

<p>He bowed good-night in his pleasantest manner,
and the ladies from the fourth floor reluctantly
withdrew to the elevator, but fifteen minutes later
surreptitiously tapped at the private door of the
room they understood to be Aunt Crete’s.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br /><br />

<small>LUELLA’S HUMILIATION</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> door was opened cautiously by the maid,
who was “doing” Aunt Crete’s hair, having just
finished a most refreshing facial massage given at
Donald’s express orders.</p>

<p>Aunt Crete looked round upon her visitors with
a rested, rosy countenance, which bloomed out
under her fluff of soft, white hair, and quite
startled her sister with its freshness and youth.
Could it be possible that this was really her sister
Crete; or had she made a terrible mistake, and
entered the wrong apartment?</p>

<p>But a change came suddenly over the ruddy
countenance of Aunt Crete as over the face of a
child that in the midst of happy play sees a trouble
descending upon it. A look almost of terror came
over her, and she caught her breath, and waited
to see what was coming.</p>

<p>“Why, Carrie, Luella!” she gasped weakly. “I
thought you’d gone to bed. Marie’s just doing up
my hair for night. She’s been giving me a face-massage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
You ought to try one. It makes you
feel young again.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” said her affronted sister. “I shouldn’t
care for one.”</p>

<p>Marie looked over Luella and her mother, beginning
with the painfully elaborate arrangement
of hair, and going down to the tips of their boots.
Luella’s face burned with mortification as she read
the withering disapproval in the French woman’s
countenance.</p>

<p>“Let’s sit down till she’s done,” said Luella,
dropping promptly on the foot of Aunt Crete’s bed
and gazing around in frank surprise over the spaciousness
of the apartment.</p>

<p>Thereupon the maid ignored them, and went
about her work, brushing out and deftly manipulating
the wavy white hair, and chattering pleasantly
meanwhile, just as if no one else were in the
room. Aunt Crete tried to forget what was before
her, or, rather, behind her; but her hands
trembled a little as they lay in her lap in the folds
of the pretty pink and gray challis kimono she
wore; and all of a sudden she remembered the unwhitewashed
cellar, and the uncooked jam, and
the unmade shirt-waists, and the little hot brick
house gazing at her reproachfully from the distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
home, and she here in this fine array, forgetting
it all and being waited upon by a maid—a
lazy truant from her duty.</p>

<p>Did the heart of the maid divine the state of
things, or was it only her natural instinct that
made her turn to protect the pleasant little
woman, in whose service she had already been well
paid, against the two women that were so evidently
of the common walks of life, and were trying
to ape those that in the eyes of the maid were
their betters? However it was, Marie prolonged
her duties a good half-hour, and Luella’s impatience
waxed furious, so that she lost her fear of
the maid gradually, and yawned loudly, declaring
that Aunt Crete had surely had enough fussing
over for one evening.</p>

<p>They held in their more personal remarks until
the door finally closed upon Marie, but burst forth
so immediately that she heard the opening sentences
through the transom, and thought it wise
to step to the young gentleman’s door and warn
him that his elderly relative of whom he seemed
so careful was likely to be disturbed beyond a reasonable
hour for retiring. Then she discreetly
withdrew, having not only added to her generous
income by a good bit of silver, but also having followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
out the dictates of her heart, which had
taken kindly to the gentle woman of the handsome
clothes and few pretensions.</p>

<p>“Well, upon my word! I should think you’d be
ashamed, Aunt Crete!” burst forth Luella, arising
from the bed in a majesty of wrath. “Sitting
there, being waited on like a baby, when you ought
to be at home this minute earning your living.
What do you think of yourself, anyway, living in
this kind of luxury when you haven’t a cent in
the world of your own, and your own sister, who
has supported you for years, up in a little dark
fourth-floor room? Such selfishness I never saw
in all my life. I wouldn’t have believed it of you,
though we might have suspected it long ago from
the foolish things you were always doing. Aunt
Crete, have you any idea how much all this costs?”</p>

<p>She waved her hand tragically over the handsome
room, including the trunk standing open,
and the gleam of silver-gray silk that peeped
through the half-open closet door. Aunt Crete
fairly cringed under Luella’s scornful eyes.</p>

<p>“And you, nothing in the world but a beggar, a
<i>beggar</i>! That’s what you are—a beggar dependent
upon <i>us</i>; and you swelling around as if you
owned the earth, and daring to wear silk dresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and real lace collars and expensive jewelry, and
even having a maid, and shaming your own relatives,
and getting in ahead of us, who have always
been good to you, and taking away our friends,
and making us appear like two cents! It’s just
fierce, Aunt Crete! It’s—it’s <i>heathenish</i>!” Luella
paused in her anger for a fitting word, and then
took the first one that came.</p>

<p>Aunt Crete winced. She was devoted to the
Woman’s Missionary Society, and it was terrible
to be likened to a heathen. She wished Luella
had chosen some other word.</p>

<p>“I should think you’d be so ashamed you couldn’t
hold your head up before your honest relatives,”
went on the shameless girl. “Taking money from
a stranger,—that’s what he is, a <i>stranger</i>,—and
you whining round and lowering yourself to let
him buy you clothes and things, as if you didn’t
have proper clothes suited to your age and station.
He’s a young upstart coming along and daring to
buy you any—and such clothes! Do you know
you’re a laughing-stock? What would Mrs.
Grandon say if she knew whom she was inviting
to her automobile rides and dinners? Think of
you in your old purple calico washing the dishes
at home, and scrubbing the kitchen, and ask yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
what you would say if Mrs. Grandon should
come to call on you, and find you that way. You’re
a hypocrite, Aunt Crete, an awful hypocrite!”</p>

<p>Luella towered over Aunt Crete, and the little
old lady looked into her eyes with a horrible fascination,
while her great grief and horror poured
down her sweet face in tears of anguish that
would not be stayed. Her kindly lips were quivering,
and her eyes were wide with the tears.</p>

<p>Luella saw that she was making an impression,
and she went on more wildly than before, her fury
growing with every word, and not realizing how
loud her voice was.</p>

<p>“And it isn’t enough that you should do all that,
but now you’re going to spoil my prospects with
Clarence Grandon. You can’t keep up this masquerade
long; and, when they find out what you
really are, what will they think of <i>me</i>? It’ll be
all over with me, and it’ll be your fault, Aunt
Crete, your fault, and you’ll never have a happy
moment afterwards, thinking of how you spoiled
my life.”</p>

<p>“Now, Luella,” broke in Aunt Crete solemnly
through her tears, “you’re mistaken about one
thing. It won’t be my fault there, for it wouldn’t
have made a bit of difference, poor child. I’m real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
sorry for you, and I meant to tell you just as soon
as we got home, for I couldn’t bear to spoil your
pleasure while we were here; but that Clarence
Grandon belongs to some one else. He ain’t for
you, Luella, and there must have been some mistake
about it. Perhaps he was just being kind to
you. For Donald knows him real well, and he
says he’s engaged to a girl out West, and they’re
going to be married this fall; and Donald says
she’s real sweet and——”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 405px;">
<img src="images/i-136.jpg" width="405" height="500" alt="Luella screeching and pointing accusingly at Aunt Crete" />
<div class="caption">“‘IT’S A LIE! I SAY IT’S A LIE!’”</div>
</div>

<p>But Aunt Crete’s quavering voice stopped suddenly
in mild affright, for Luella sprang toward
her like some mad creature, shaking her finger in
her aunt’s face, and screaming at the top of her
voice:</p>

<p>“It’s a lie! I say it’s a lie! Aunt Crete, you’re
a liar; that’s what you are with all the rest.”</p>

<p>And the high-strung, uncontrolled girl burst
into angry sobs.</p>

<p>No one heard the gentle knock that had been
twice repeated during the scene, and no one saw
the door open until they all suddenly became
aware that Donald stood in the room, looking
from one face to another in angry surprise.</p>

<p>Donald had not retired at once after bidding
Aunt Crete good night. He found letters and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
telegrams awaiting his attention, and he had been
busy writing a letter of great importance when
the maid gave him the hint of Aunt Crete’s late
callers. Laying down his pen, he stepped quietly
across the private parlor that separated his room
from his aunt’s, and stopped a moment before the
door to make sure he heard voices. Then he had
knocked, and knocked again, unable to keep from
hearing the most of Luella’s tirade.</p>

<p>His indignation knew no bounds, and he concluded
his time had come to interfere; so he
opened the door, and went in.</p>

<p>“What does all this mean?” he asked in a tone
that frightened his Aunt Carrie, and made Luella
stop her angry sobs in sudden awe.</p>

<p>No one spoke, and Aunt Crete looked a mute appeal
through her tears. “What is it, dear aunt?”
he said, stepping over by her side, and placing
his arm protectingly round the poor, shrinking
little figure, who somehow in her sorrow and helplessness
reminded him strongly of his own lost
mother. He could not remember at that moment
that the other woman, standing hard and cold
and angry across the room, was also his mother’s
sister. She did not look like his mother, nor act
like her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Aunt Crete put her little curled white head in
its crisping-pins down on Donald’s coat-sleeve,
and shrank into her pink and gray kimono appealingly
as she tried to speak.</p>

<p>“It’s just as I told you, Donald, you dear boy,”
she sobbed out. “I—oughtn’t to have come. I knew
it, but it wasn’t your fault. It was all mine. I
ought to have stayed at home, and not dressed
up and come off here. I’ve had a beautiful time;
but it wasn’t for me, and I oughtn’t to have taken
it. It’s just spoiled Luella’s nice time, and she’s
blaming me, just as I knew she would.”</p>

<p>“What does my cousin mean by using that terrible
word to you, which I heard as I entered the
room?”</p>

<p>Donald’s voice was keen and scathing, and his
eyes fairly piercing as he asked the question and
looked straight at Luella, who answered not a
word.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t just what she’d have meant,
Donald,” said Aunt Crete apologetically. “She was
most out of her mind with trouble. You see I had
to tell her what you told me about that Clarence
Grandon being engaged to another girl——”</p>

<p>“Aunt Crete, don’t say another word about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
that!” burst out Luella with flashing eyes and
crimson face.</p>

<p>“For mercy’s sake, Crete, can’t you hold your
tongue?” said Luella’s mother sharply.</p>

<p>“Go on, Aunt Crete; did my cousin call you a
liar for saying that? Yet it was entirely true.
If she is not disposed to believe me either, I can
call Mr. Grandon in to testify in the matter. He
will come if I send for him. But I feel sure, after
all, that that will not be necessary. It is probably
true, as Aunt Crete says, that you were excited,
Luella, and did not mean what you said;
and after a good night’s sleep you will be prepared
to apologize to Aunt Crete, and be sorry
enough for worrying her. I am going to ask you
to leave Aunt Crete now, and let her rest. She
has had a wearying day, and needs to be quiet at
once. She is my mother’s sister, you know, and
I feel as if I must take care of her.”</p>

<p>“You seem to forget that I am your mother’s
sister, too,” said Aunt Carrie coldly, as she stood
stiff and disapproving beside the door, ready to
pass out.</p>

<p>“If I do, Aunt Carrie, forgive me,” said Donald
courteously. “It is not strange when you remember
that you forgot that I was your sister’s child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and ran away from me. But never mind; we
will put that aside and try to forget it. Good
night, Aunt Carrie. Good night, Cousin Luella.
We will all feel better about it in the morning.”</p>

<p>They bowed their diminished heads, and went
with shame and confusion to the fourth floor
back; and, when the door was closed upon them,
they burst into angry talk, each blaming the other,
until at last Luella sank in a piteous heap upon the
bed, and gave herself over to helpless tears.</p>

<p>“Luella,” said her mother in a business-like
tone, “you stop that bawling, and sit up here and
answer me some questions. Did you or did you
not go riding with Mr. Clarence Grandon last
winter in his automobile?”</p>

<p>Luella paused in her grief, and nodded assent
hopelessly.</p>

<p>“Well, how’d it come about? There’s no use
sniffing. Tell me exactly.”</p>

<p>“Why, it was a rainy day,” sobbed out the girl,
“and I met him on the street in front of the public
library the day I’d been to take back ‘The Legacy
of Earl Crafton,’ and that other book by the same
author——”</p>

<p>“Never mind what books; tell me what happened,”
said the exasperated mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, if you’re going to be cross, I sha’n’t tell
you anything,” was the filial reply; and for a moment
nothing was heard in the room but sobs.</p>

<p>However, Luella recovered the thread of her
story, and went on to relate how in company with
a lot of other girls she had met Mr. Grandon the
day before at the golf-links, where a championship
game was being played. She did not explain
the various manœuvres by which she had
contrived to be introduced to him, nor that he had
not seemed to know her at first when she bowed
in front of the library building. She had called
out, “It’s a fine day for ducks, Mr. Grandon; isn’t
it good the game was yesterday instead of to-day?”
and he had asked her to ride home with
him.</p>

<p>That was her version. Her mother by dint of
careful questioning finally arrived at the fact that
the girl had more than hinted to be taken home,
having loudly announced her lack of rubbers and
umbrella, though she seldom wore rubbers, and
had on a rain-coat and an old hat.</p>

<p>“But how about the big box of chocolates he
sent you, Luella? That was a very particular attention
to show you if he was engaged.”</p>

<p>“O,” pouted Luella, “I don’t suppose that meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
anything either, for I caught him in a philopena
on the way home that day. We said the same
words at the same time, something like ‘It’s going
to clear off,’ and I told him, when we girls did
that, the one that spoke first had to give the other
a box of chocolates; so the next day he sent them.”</p>

<p>“Luella, I never brought you up to do things
like that. I don’t think that was very nice.”</p>

<p>“O, now, ma, don’t you preach. I guess you
weren’t a saint when you were a girl. Besides, I
don’t think you’re very sympathetic.” She mopped
her swollen eyes.</p>

<p>“Luella, didn’t he ever pay you any more attention
after that? I kind of thought you thought
he liked you, by the way you talked.”</p>

<p>“No, he never even looked at me,” sobbed the
girl, her grief breaking out afresh. “He didn’t
even know me the next time we met, but stared
straight at me till I bowed, and then he gave me a
cold little touch of his hat. And down here he
hasn’t even recognized me once. I suppose that
lady mother of his didn’t like my looks.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Luella; I wish you’d act sensible.
This has been pretty expensive trying to run
around after the Grandons. Here’s the hotel bills,
and all that dress-making, and now no telling how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Aunt Crete will act after we get home. Like as
not she’ll think she’s got to have a maid, and dress
in silks and satins. There’s one comfort; probably
some of her clothes will fix over for you when
she gets off her high horse and comes down to
every-day living again. But I wish you’d brace
up and forget these Grandons. It’s no use trying
to get up in the world higher than you belong.
There’s that nice John Peters would have been
real devoted to you if you’d just let him; and he
owns a house of his own already, and has the
name of being the best plumber in Midvale.”</p>

<p>Luella sighed.</p>

<p>“He’s only a plumber, ma, and his hands are all
red and rough.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s that?” snapped her practical
mother. “He may have his own automobile before
long, for all that. Now dry up your eyes, and go
to sleep; and in the morning do you go down real
early, and apologize to your silly Aunt Crete, and
make her understand that she’s not to disgrace us
under any consideration by going in bathing while
she’s here. My land! I expect to see her riding
round on one of those saddle-ponies on the beach
next, or maybe driving that team of goats we saw
to-day, with pink ribbon reins. Come now, Luella,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
don’t you worry. Set out to show your cousin
Donald how nice you can be, and maybe some of
the silk dresses will come your way. Anyhow,
this can’t last forever, and John Peters is at home
when we get there.”</p>

<p>So Luella, soothed in spirit, went to bed, and
arose very early the next morning, descending
upon poor Aunt Crete while yet the dreams of
sailing alone with Donald on a moonlit sea were
mingling with her waking thoughts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br /><br />

<small>AUNT CRETE’S PARTNERSHIP</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Luella</span> did her work quietly, firmly, and thoroughly.
She vanished before Marie had thought
of coming to her morning duties.</p>

<p>At breakfast-time Donald found a sad, cowed
little woman waiting for him to go down to the
dining-room. He tried to cheer her up by telling
her how nice a time they were to have in bathing
that morning, for the water was sure to be delightful;
but Aunt Crete shook her head sadly,
and said she guessed she had better not go in bathing
any more. Then she sighed, and looked wistfully
out on the blue waves dancing in the sunshine.</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel well, Aunt Crete?” asked Donald
anxiously.</p>

<p>“O, yes, real well,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Did it hurt you to go in yesterday, do you
think?”</p>

<p>“No, not a mite,” she responded promptly.</p>

<p>“Then why in the name of common sense don’t
you want to go in to-day? Has Luella been trying
to talk some of her nonsense?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Luella thinks my figger looks so bad in a
bathing-suit. She says of course you want to be
polite to me, but you don’t really know how folks
will laugh at me, and make her ashamed of belonging
to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I like that!” said Donald. “You just tell
Miss Luella we’re not running this vacation for
her sole benefit. Now, Aunt Crete, you’re going
in bathing, or else I won’t go, and you wouldn’t
like to deprive me of that pleasure, would you?
Well, I thought not. Now come on down to breakfast,
and we’ll have the best day yet. Don’t you
let Luella worry you. And, by the way, Aunt
Crete, I’m thinking of taking a run up to Cape
Cod, and perhaps getting a glimpse of the coast
of Maine before I get through. How would you
like to go with me?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Aunt Crete in a daze of delight.
“Could I?” Then, mindful of Luella’s mocking
words the night before: “But I musn’t be an expense
to you. I’d just be a burden. You know
I haven’t a cent of my own in the world; so I
couldn’t pay my way, and you’ve done a great deal
more than I ought to have let you do.”</p>

<p>“Now, Aunt Crete, once for all you must get
that idea out of your head. You could never be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
burden to me. I want you for a companion. If
my mother were here, shouldn’t I just love to take
her on a journey with me, and spend every cent
I had to make her happy? Well, I haven’t mother
here; but you are the nearest to mother I can find,
and I somehow feel she’d like me to have you in
her place. Will you come? Or is it asking too
much to ask you to leave Aunt Carrie and Cousin
Luella? They’ve got each other, and they never
really needed you as I do. I’ve got plenty of
money for us to do as we please, and I mean it
with all my heart. Will you come and stay with
me? I may have to take a flying trip to Europe
before the summer’s over; and, if I do, it would
be dreadfully lonesome to go alone. I think you’d
like a trip on the ocean, wouldn’t you? and a peep
at London, and perhaps Paris and Vienna and
old Rome for a few days? And in the fall I’m
booked for work in my old university. It’s only
an assistant professorship yet, but it means a big
thing for a young fellow like me, and I want you
to come with me and make a cozy little home for
me between whiles and a place where I can bring
my friends when they get homesick.”</p>

<p>He paused and looked down for an answer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
was almost startled by the glory of joy in Aunt
Crete’s face.</p>

<p>“O Donald, could I do that? Could I be that
to you? Do you really think I could be of use
enough to you to earn my living?”</p>

<p>He stooped and kissed her forehead reverently
to hide the tears that had come unbidden to his
eyes. It touched him beyond measure that this
sweet life had been so empty of love and so full of
drudgery that she should speak thus about so
simple a matter. It filled him with indignation
against those who had taken the sweetness from
her and given her the dregs of a life instead.</p>

<p>“Dear aunt,” he said, “you could be of great
use to me, and more than earn anything I could
do for you many times over, just by being yourself
and mothering me; but as for work, there is
not to be one stroke done except just what you
want to do for amusement. We’ll have servants
to do all the work, and you shall manage them. I
want you for an ornament in my home, and you
are going to have a good rest and a continual vacation
the rest of your life, if I know anything about
it. Now come down to breakfast, so we can go in
bathing early, and don’t you worry another
wrinkle about Luella. You don’t belong to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
any more. We’ll send her a parasol from New
York and a party gown from Paris, and she won’t
bother her pompadour any more about you, you
may be sure.”</p>

<p>In a maze of delight Aunt Crete went down to
breakfast, and dawned upon the astonished vision
of her sister and niece in all the beauty of her
dainty white morning costume. They were fairly
startled at the vision she was in white, with her
pretty white hair to match it. Luella gasped and
held her disapproving breath, but Aunt Crete was
too absorbed in the vision of joy that had opened
before her to know or care what they thought of
her in a white dress.</p>

<p>No girl in the new joy of her first love was ever
in a sweeter dream of bliss than was Aunt Crete
as she beamed through her breakfast. Luella’s
looks of scorn and Luella’s mother’s sour visage
had no effect upon her whatever. She smiled happily,
and ate her breakfast in peace, for had she
not been set free forever from the things that had
made her life a burden heretofore, and shown into
a large place of new joys where her heart might
find rest?</p>

<p>After breakfast Donald made them all walk
down the board walk to the various shops filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
with curios, where he bought everything that
Luella looked at, and lavished several gifts also
upon her mother, including a small Oriental rug
that she admired. They returned to the hotel in
a good humor, and Luella began to have visions
of luxurious days to come. She felt sure she could
keep Aunt Crete down about where she wanted
her, and her eyes gloated over the beautiful white
dress that she hoped to claim for her own when
they all went home and she had convinced Aunt
Crete how unsuitable white was for old ladies.</p>

<p>She was quite astonished, after her morning
talk with her aunt, to hear Donald say as he looked
at his watch, “Come, Aunt Crete, it’s time for our
bath,” and to see Aunt Crete walk smiling off
toward the bath-houses, utterly regardless of her
wrathful warning glances. It was rather disconcerting
to have Aunt Crete become unmanageable
right at the beginning this way. But in view
of the fact that her hands were filled with pretty
trifles bought by her cousin she did not feel like
making any protest beyond threatening glances,
which the dear soul whose mind was in Europe,
and whose heart was in a cozy little home all her
own and Donald’s, did not see at all.</p>

<p>Aunt Crete was happy. She felt it in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
nerve of her body as she stepped into the crisp
waves and bounded out to meet them with the
elasticity of a girl.</p>

<p>Luella, following a moment later in her flashy
bathing-suit of scarlet and white, watched her
aunt in amazement, and somehow felt that Aunt
Crete was drifting away from her, separated by
something more than a few yards of blue salt
water.</p>

<p>Donald kept up a continual flow of bright conversation
during the noon meal, and managed to
engage Luella and her mother on the long piazza
in looking through the marine-glass at a great
ship that went lazily floating by, while Aunt Crete
was getting ready to go on the ride; and before
Luella and her mother were quite aware of what
was happening they stood on the piazza watching
Aunt Crete in her handsome black crêpe de chine,
which even boasted a modest train, and her black
lace wrap and bonnet, being handed into the
Grandon motor-car, while Donald carried her long
new gray cloak on his arm. The gray car moved
smoothly away out of sight, and Luella and her
mother were left staring at the sea with their own
bitter reflections.</p>

<p>The automobile party did not return until late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
that night, for the moon was full and the roads
were fine; and Donald saw to it that Aunt Crete
was guarded against any intrusion.</p>

<p>It was at breakfast next morning that Donald
told them, and Aunt Crete sat listening with the
rapt smile that a slave might have worn as he listened
to the reading of the proclamation of emancipation.</p>

<p>“Aunt Carrie,” he began as pleasantly as if he
were about to propose that they all go rowing,
“Aunt Crete and I have decided to set up a permanent
partnership. She has consented to come and
mother me. I have accepted a position in my old
university, and I am very tired of boarding. I
think we shall have a cozy, pleasant home; and
we’ll be glad to have you and Luella come and visit
us sometimes after we get settled and have some
good servants so that Aunt Crete will have plenty
of time to take you around and show you the
sights. In the meantime, it is very likely that I
may have to take a brief trip abroad for the university.
If so, I shall probably start in about a
week, and before that I want to get a glimpse of
the New England coast. I have decided to take
Aunt Crete, and run away from you to-day. We
leave on the noon train; so there is time for a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
frolic yet. Suppose we go down to the board
walk, and eat an ice-cream cone. I saw some delicious
ones last night that made my mouth water,
and we haven’t had that experience yet. We’ll
get some rolling chairs so that Aunt Crete won’t
be too tired for her journey. Come, Aunt Crete,
you won’t need to go up-stairs again, shall you? I
told Marie about the packing. It won’t be necessary
for you to go back until it’s time for you to
change to your travelling-garb.”</p>

<p>In a daze of anger and humiliation Luella and
her mother climbed into their double rolling chair,
and ate their ice-cream cones sullenly, propelled
by a large, lazy colored boy; but Aunt Crete had a
chair to herself, and was attended by Donald, who
kept up a constant stream of delightfully funny
conversation about the people and things they
passed that made Aunt Crete laugh until the tears
came into her happy eyes.</p>

<p>There was no opportunity for Luella and her
mother to talk to Aunt Crete alone, even after
they returned to the hotel; for Donald kept himself
in evidence everywhere, until at last Luella
made bold to declare that she didn’t see why
Donald thought he had a right to come and take
Aunt Crete away from them, when they had always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
taken care of her; and her mother added in
an injured tone:</p>

<p>“Yes, you don’t seem to realize what a burden
it’s been all these years, having to support Crete,
and her so childish and unreasonable in a great
many ways, and not having any idea of the value
of money. I’ve spent a good deal on Crete, take
it all in all; and now, when Luella’s going out, and
has to have clothes and company, it’s rather hard
to have her leave us in the lurch this way, and me
with all the work to do.”</p>

<p>“That being the case, Aunt Carrie,” said Donald
pleasantly, “I should suppose you’d be very glad to
have me relieve you of the burden of Aunt Crete’s
support, for it will be nothing but a pleasure to
me to care for her the rest of her life. As for
what you have spent for her, just run it over in
your mind, and I shall be quite glad to re-imburse
you. Aunt Crete is really too frail and sweet to
have to work any longer. I should think my cousin
was almost old enough to be a help to you now,
and she looks perfectly strong and able to work.”</p>

<p>Luella flashed a vindictive glance at her cousin,
and turned haughtily toward the window; then
the porter came for the trunks, and the travellers
said a hasty good-by, and flitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>


<p>As Donald shook hands with Luella in parting,
he looked merrily into her angry eyes, and said:</p>

<p>“I do hope, Luella, that it hasn’t been too much
of a trial to have your ‘backwoods cousin’ spend
a few days here. You’ll find a box of bonbons up
in your room, if the porter did his duty, which
may sweeten your bitter thoughts of me; and we
hope you’ll have a delightful time the remainder
of your stay here. Good-by.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About three months after Donald had returned
from Europe and settled to his Western university
life Aunt Crete received a letter from her sister.
It was brief and to the point, and Aunt Crete could
read between the lines. It read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>Dear Crete</i>,—Aren’t you about sick of that nonsense,
and ready to come home? Luella has decided
that she can’t do better than take John Peters. He
has promised to buy an auto next year, if the plumbing
business keeps up. I think at least you might
come home and help get her things ready; for there’s
a great deal of sewing to do, and you know I can’t
afford to hire it; and Luella’s out so much, now she’s
engaged. Do come soon.</p>

<p class='sig'>
Your sister, <span class="smcap">Carrie</span>.”<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Aunt Crete looked sober; but Donald, looking
over her shoulder, read, and then went to his desk
for a moment. Coming back, he dropped a check
for five hundred dollars into his aunt’s lap.</p>

<div class="caption">“AUNT CRETE WAS AT LAST EMANCIPATED”</div>
</div>

<p>“Send her that from me, Aunt Crete, and another
from yourself, if you like, and let her hire
the sewing done. They don’t want you, and I do.”</p>

<p>Aunt Crete had her own bank-account now,
thanks to her thoughtful nephew, and she smiled
back a delighted, “I will,” and went off to write
the letter; for Aunt Crete was at last emancipated.</p>
